*********************************************
TSE-Cal.  TSE Macro v2.0.  Floating point
arithmetic macro to work on text in The
SemWare Editor.  Add, subtract, multiply,
divide, and percent plus column tabulate and
average. Paste the results at the cursor.
Supercedes the April 1994 version. Includes
upgrades to Curtis Repen's math macro by Mel
Hulse. Now works with comma delimited numbers
and dollar signs.  More error checking and
comments.  Still has a few problems with
large numbers and negative number division.
Trys to eliminate most.  Use is documented in
the macro.
