If you have an older version of TSE Pro that doens't have a syntax hiliting
file for Cobol yet (cobol.syn in TSE directory "synhi"), but your TSE Pro
version is 2.8 or above, the this document describes how you can install the
included cobol.txt file as a cobol.syn file.


Start TSE with a *.cbl file, and do:
   <escape>                            (menu)
   <o>                                 (options or other)
   <f>                                 (full configuration)
   <d>                                 (display/color options)
   <x>                                 (configure syntax hilite mapping sets)
   Current (or Create New)
   <o>                                 (overlay settings from mapping text file)
   "drive:your-unzip-path\cobol.txt"

If you have not done so yet, configure "associated file extensions"
and other syntax-hiliting options, like colors.

After several <escape>'s, TSE saves a cobol.syn file,
preferably in \tse32\synhi\cobol.syn.

Cobol.txt is now obsolete and can be deleted.
