TSE Pro/32 v2.8 upwards:
This macro remedies three potential Cobol
issues:
-  All TSE Pro versions are not capable of
   coloring columns, neither column 1 thru 6
   nor column 73 thru the end of line.
-  Cobol versions up to and including
   Cobol-85 indicate comments by putting an
   asterisk or a slash on column 7.
   Since version 3.0 TSE Pro supports this
   with to-end-of-line syntax hiliting if a
   configurable character is present at a
   configurable column.
   TSE Pro 2.8 users need this macro to do
   the same.
-  For older versions of TSE you can also
   install a Cobol syntax-hiliting file.
The macro can also be configured for
syntax-hiliting Fortran comments.
