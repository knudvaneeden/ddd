#  Note: A line with a "#" on column 1 is considered a comment.
#  Note: The file must end with an empty line.
#  Note: It is absolutely forbidden to transfer the same file(s) both
#        ways between directories. Because files are also transferred
#        based on a difference in size, there would be no way to tell
#        which way a file would be transferred. On the plus side, also
#        basing file transfers on size makes sure that partially
#        created or transferred files are transferred again.
#  Note: It is allowed and efficient to transfer different files in
#        opposite ways between the "from" and the "to" directory.
#        Hereto an optional "filespec_back" directive is available.
#  Note: The "pause" and "log_file" directives are optinal and global,
#        and need not be repeated for the other directories.
#        The defaults are "10" seconds and file "c:\tseftp.log".
#  Note: An end_pause of 0 seconds signifies "no loop": do syncdir only once.
