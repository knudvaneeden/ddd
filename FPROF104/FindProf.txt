    FindProf - Find TSE's Global Profile (TSE.INI or TSEPRO.INI)

    INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    This macro helps to locate TSE's preferences file.  It is
    designed to be included in your own macros, so that you can
    use the Profile Functions without keeping track of which INI
    file you are using or which version of the editor:

        #ifndef WIN32
        #include ["profile.si"]
        #endif

        #include ["FindProf.si"]

        GetProfileStr('My_Settings', 'My_Key', '', FindProfile())

    FindProf tries first to locate an existing file named TSE.INI
    or TSEPRO.INI.  It searches the editor's macro directories
    (i.e. TSEPath), then the editor's load directory (i.e. LoadDir())

    If that fails, it makes the following assumptions:

        *  If the editor is the WIN32 version, then return 'TSE.INI',
           which the Win32 Profile functions will resolve to the
           correct directory (usually C:\WINDOWS, but I imagine this
           may be a user profile directory in some setups).

        *  If the editor is the DOS version, then return
           LoadDir() + 'TSEPRO.INI', for compatibility with Chris Antos'
           INI.* macros.

    When FindProfile() finally decides on a file, it caches the filename
    in the session global variable 'FindProfile:TSE_Global_Profile',
    so it doesn't have to repeat the search again.

    It follows the rules in the SetCache package, however.  If you run
    the SReload macro from that package, FindProfile() will search
    again for the proper .INI file at its next opportunity.
