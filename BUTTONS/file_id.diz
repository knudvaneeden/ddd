(08-28-01) TSE Pro/32 v3.0 (v2.6/2.8 partial)
These macros add two buttons to TSE's user
interface emulating some of the mouse
interfaces which work for GUI application but
usually do not work for console applications.
The X-button, when clicked, closes TSE by
calling the quickxit macro. The S-button
allows you to resize TSE in terms of rows and
columns using a mouse and to quickly
minimize, maximize and restore it. Note: SBTN
only works for TSE-Pro32 v3.0.
