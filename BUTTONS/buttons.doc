1. Synopsis
-----------

These macros add two buttons to TSE's user interface emulating some of the
mouse interfaces which work for GUI application but usually do not work for
console applications. The X-button, when clicked, closes TSE by calling the
quickxit macro. The S-button allows you to resize TSE in terms of rows and
columns using a mouse and to quickly minimize, maximize and restore it.
Note: SBTN only works for TSE-Pro32 v3.0.


2. Installation
---------------

Copy the macros into the MAC folder and compile them, e.g. by typing

    sc32 xbtn
    sc32 sbtn

at a prompt. Next, run TSE and pull down the Macro menu and choose Autoload
List. Press <Ins>, type XBTN at the prompt and press <Enter>. Repeat for the
SBTN macro. Press <Enter> to save the changes. Finally, restart TSE.

To uninstall the buttons, open the Autoload List, select XBTN and press
<Del>. Repeat for the SBTN macro and press <Enter> to save the changes.
Finally, delete the files in the MAC folder, e.g. by typing

    del xbtn.*
    del sbtn.*

at a prompt.


3. Using the X-button
---------------------

XBTN adds a yellow X on a red background to the upper right corner of TSE's
window. To close TSE click this button. If there are any modified files, a
menu will pop up asking you what to do. Otherwise TSE will simply be closed.


4. Using the S-button
---------------------

SBTN adds a yellow S on a red background to the lower right corner of TSE's
window. If you click this button, hold the mouse button and drag the mouse,
a status box indicating the current position of the mouse in terms of rows
and columns is displayed. When the mouse button is released TSE's window
will be resized such that the lower right corner of the window moves to the
mouse cursor. This works exactly like resizing a GUI application by dragging
it at the lower right corner. To cancel resizing press the escape key while
still holding the mouse button.

Right clicking the S button or pressing <Alt -> will pop up a menu which
allows you to shrink TSE to thumb nail size or maximize the window to screen
size. Right clicking the button or pressing <Alt -> again while TSE is
minimized or maximized will restore the window to its previous position and
size.

Note: resizing the window with the mouse when running Win9X doesn't always
work as expected. When the console font is set to AUTO (this is the default)
shrinking the window not only shrinks TSE in terms of rows and columns but
also reduces the size of the font :-(. Currently, I know only of one way to
fix this behavior: set the console font to a fixed size. To make this a
permanent solution either start TSE through a link and fix the font size for
this link or edit the properties of conagent. Conagent is located in the
system folder (usually c:\windows\system). Right click CONAGENT.EXE and
choose properties. Click the Font tab and choose a font size, except AUTO of
course :-). Finally click OK. This changes the startup font size of all
console applications on your machine, however, including the DOS prompt.


5. Customizing
--------------

If you don't like the colors of the buttons, load the macros into the editor
and search the following constants XNormalColor, XClickedColor (XBTN) and
ButtonColor (SBTN) and change them to your liking. If SBTN's menu key clashes
with your key assignment, load the macro, search the MENU_KEY constant and
change the key definition.
