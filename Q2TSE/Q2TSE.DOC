                                 Q2TSE

    Q2TSE is a TSE version 2.5 macro designed to assist with upgrading from
    TSE Jr./TSE Jr to TSE Pro.  This macro will not completely convert
    TSE Jr./TSE Jr to TSE Pro due to the major difference in the the
    products and their macro languages. However, it will convert enough
    to give a good base to build upon.

    Depending on the complexity of your TSE Jr. macros, this macro may be
    able to convert on average: 90 percent.  Following are a few of the
    things that the macro cannot convert:

        - Any macro that uses the "Pause" command.
        - Any macro that has repeated commands.
        - Any macro that has commands being used within prompts.
           (i.e.  EditFile EndLine Backspace Backspace Backspace "$$$" Return)

    Q2TSE will work with TSE Jr. versions 2.07a and greater, and TSE Jr
    4.0.  To use the macro, change to the directory where the Q2TSE.MAC
    file is located and enter the following at the DOS prompt:

            e -eq2tse

    If you have renamed your TSE executable (E.EXE) to something else, then
    replace the 'e' in the line above with the new name of your E.EXE.

    The Q2TSE MainMenu is as follows:

    CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ONLY:

    This part of the Q2TSE macro will read the configuration settings
    directly from the specified TSE Jr. executable file and write them to The
    SemWare Editor executable file.  You will then have the option to write
    the settings out to an ASCII file in the same format that is produced by
    the IConfig macro.  See the documentation on configuring the editor for
    more details on how this file can be used.  NOTE: It is not necessary to
    generate this file.  The options read from the TSE Jr. executable will be
    written directly to the TSE executable.  Most of them will also
    immediately take effect.  It is suggested that you exit the editor and
    restart to force all of the options to take effect.


    MACROS ONLY:

    This part of the Q2TSE macro will convert a TSE Jr. configuration file into
    a TSE user interface file.  After supplying the names for the files, the
    macro will then parse the TSE Jr. configuration file and generate the TSE
    file.  Due to the vast difference between the macro languages, there are
    MANY things that cannot be mechanically converted.  Anytime something
    cannot be converted, an appropriate "Warn(...)" statement will be
    assigned in the TSE file.  Once the conversion is complete, you should
    review the new TSE file, find each of the "Warn(...)" statements and
    manually convert the macro.

    You may also use this to convert any external TSE Jr. macros.  When you are
    conversion external macros, be sure to use a ".S" extension for the TSE
    filename.  The default filename has a ".UI" extension which is used for
    TSE User Interface files.  You should only use the ".UI" extension when
    creating files that you wish to "burn-in" to the TSE executable.


    BOTH CONFIGURATION AND MACROS:

    Selecting this option will invoke both of the previous options beginning
    with the Configuration Options, then the Macros option.
