Overview
--------

KeyFind.S and KeyAssgn.S are a pair of macros which allow you to search
for key assignments and display which command is assigned to a key,
respectively.


Quick Start
-----------

Compile the macros (they work for both v2.5 and v2.6 of the editor) and
put the mac files into your favorite macro directory. If you installed
TSE using the factory defaults directory layout and if you're using
TSE.UI, you can start using them immediately.


Custom Installation
-------------------

Both macros work their "magic" by searching the UI file for key
assignments. Thus, for them to work properly they must be able to find a
file which defines your key assignments. Both macros use a pair of
global string variables to define the placement of this file: cmd_path
and cmd_file. The first one defines the directory where this file can be
found (relative to the place where TSE is located) and the second one
defines the name of that file.

Let's assume, you have installed TSE using the following, fully
customized directory structure:

        c:\utils
        |
        +-- tse
            |
            +-- my_macs
                |
                +-- source
                +-- ui

Let's also suppose that your UI file is called my_stuff.ui. Then the two
variables must be as follows:

        cmd_path = "my_macs\ui\"
        cmd_name = "my_stuff.ui"

(Don't forget the trailing backslash in cmd_path.)

If you are using the factory defaults and have deleted the UI file, you
have to re-install the editor to get this file. The best way to do this,
is to install TSE into some temporary directory, move the UI directory
and its contents over to your current installation and, finally, get rid
of the temporary directory.


Extending the Help Menu
-----------------------

You might want to bind these macros to your help menu. Here's how to do
this. First load both this file and your UI file into TSE. Next search
the string "menu HelpMenu()" with the options "gi" within your UI file.
This should located the help menu. Now copy the following lines into the
menu definition.

    "&Find Key...",             ExecMacro("keyfind")
    "&Display Assignments...",  ExecMacro("keyassgn")

Finally, re-install the UI.


Using the Macros
----------------

This is rather simple. KeyFind displays a prompt where you can enter
some text (or regular expression) which should be located. Press enter
and the macro will present some key assignments which include the search
string. You can sort this list by Key (Alt-K) and Command (Alt-C) or
search again (Enter). As usual, the list is dismissed by pressing the
Escape key. Using KeyAssgn is even simpler. Execute it, press some key
(including alt-,ctrl-,shift-combinations and double keys) and the macro
will tell you which command is assigned to that key. Again press Escape
to close the prompt box.
