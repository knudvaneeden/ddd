BH is a small utility created to ease searching for words in Windows
Help files from a DOS session running under Windows, for example, from
a DOS editor like TSE Pro.

Installation
============
BH is a Windows program, to be able to run it from a DOS session it is
need some way to run Windows apps from the command line.
In Windows 95 and Windows NT this is not a problem, the system allows
this without any help, but under Windows 3.1 or 3.11 some external
utility is needed, I am using some programs included in
Microsoft C/C++ 7.0: WX.EXE, WXSRV.EXE and VMB.386,these programs aren't
supplied with Microsoft Visual C++, I don't know if they can be freely
copied (I don't think so), maybe some shareware/freeware utility exist
to do this task.

    Windows 3.1 or 3.11
    --------------------
        Copy BH.EXE, WX.EXE and WXSRV.EXE to a directory accessible via
        PATH enviroment variable. Add VMB.386 to the [386Enh] section of
        SYSTEM.INI:

        [386Enh]
        ...
        device=c:\path\vmb.386
        ...

        It is also convenient to include WXSRV in the Program Manager
        start up group.
        If DOS prompt is configured to exclusive execution, change it
        to non-exclusive.
        Restart Windows.

    Windows 95 o Windows NT
    -----------------------
        Copy BH.EXE to a directory accessible via PATH enviroment variable.

Configuring BH
==============
    Use File/Run from Program Manager to run BH, or, under Windows 95 or
    WinNT, you can use the DOS command line.
    The first time you run BH it won't be yet configured and it won't
    know what .HLP file it should search. Open the system menu (in
    Windows 95 right-click in the caption bar), and select "Install
    files", add as many HLP files as you want, I recommend to first
    select the most important Help file, the one where BH can find more
    often what you usually search.

    Now type something in the Search Dialog-Box and push the "Start"
    button (or press ENTER), if there is only one HLP file installed, BH
    will open it ,search for the word you asked, and close itself. If
    there are more than one file, BH will show a list box with the
    installed files, open the first one and search, to search other file
    just click it.

Running BH from a DOS session
=============================

    BH has a simple command-line format:

        BH word_to_search

    From Windows 95 or Windows NT it is so easy, from Windows 3.1 or
    3.11 it is a little more difficult, for example, using WX:

        wx /A bh word_to_search

    In this case you should have DOS sessions configured as
    non-exclusive executing.
    If you use another utility to run Windows programs from a DOS
    session, the command line will change, but BH should get
    anyway word_to_search as a command line parameter.


Running BH from TSE Pro.
========================

Add this small macro to your TSE configuration files:

Windows 3.1 or 3.11, using WX

    proc mWinHelp()
        string sWord[80]=""
        sWord = GetWordAtCursor()            // In TSE.UI
        Dos("wx /A bh "+sWord,_DONT_PROMPT_)
    end

Windows 95 or NT

    proc mWinHelp()
        string sWord[80]=""
        sWord = GetWordAtCursor()
        Dos("bh "+sWord,_DONT_PROMPT_)
    end

and assign it to the key you prefer.

Doing this, TSE will call BH.EXE with the word under cursor as a command
line parameter, and BH will search the HLP files you previously
installed. If you invoke the macro in a blank zone, BH will ask you for
the word to search.

Notes:
======

BH use the Windows Help System, this behaves differently in Windows
3.1 and in Windows 95, for example, when searching for a topic that the
Help file doesn't contain, Win 3.1 shows you an error message while Windows
95 shows you the topic list.
Also, the Windows 95 help system changes from a Win95 build to another,
so it is possible BH doesn't work properly under some Windows 95 beta
buid. I am using it under Windows 95 build 490 and under Windows for
Workwroups 3.11.
Windows 95 final release has already been released, but I don't have it
yet, and so , I haven't tested BH. If there is something to change I
will do it as soon as I can.
