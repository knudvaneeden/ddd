-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


26 October 1995
Enclosed in this package are the following:

PGPAW.S -- a macro for TSE Pro (aka The Semware Editor) together with PGP,
   the popular and secure cryptography program for email, etc.  Using this
   macro with TSE allows one to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and add your public
   key to messages as well as add a new key to your public keyring.

HWINSIZ.S -- a TSE macro for use with mail readers like Ozcis, Tapcis,
   KWQ/2, etc.  With the correct command line, you will end up with the
   original message in an upper horizontal window covering one third of the
   screen, and your reply in the bottom window.  For example, in Tapcis
   ver. 6, use the following to setup the external editor (TSE, of
   course):

        ReplyConfig1=tse /eHwinsiz root~.tmp editor~.tmp

Both of these must be compiled before use, of course, and PGPAW.S must
first be customized for your individual paths, etc.


I have also included a couple of files that will be useful for the new
user of PGP:

PGPALT.HLP -- A help file more useful than that included in the PGP
   distribution package.  Just rename your PGP.HLP to PGPOLD.HLP, and
   rename PGPALT.HLP to PGP.HLP.  This file is taken from an unofficial
   version of PGP by John DeHaven.

PGPREFCD.TXT -- A reference card of commandline options for PGP.

Finally, I can recommend a frequently updated FAQ on PGP available at:
