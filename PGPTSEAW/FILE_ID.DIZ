PGPTSEAW.ZIP -- 26 Oct. 1995
PGPAW.S--a TSE Pro macro to use PGP to
encrypt, decrypt, sign, insert public
key, and sign messages, etc. for email.
Based on PGP032.S by Tom Klein, but
greatly changed by Anthony Williams.
Includes some added helps for using PGP
and a macro to produce two windows in
TSE when invoked from the command line.
Requires TSE Pro (aka The Semware
Editor) 2.5 (2.0 with modification) and
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).  Ideal for
use with Tapcis, Ozcis, KWQ/2, etc.
