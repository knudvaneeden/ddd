1. Synopsis
-----------

HlpLnClk is a small TSE add-in which makes the TSE help line mouse
sensitive. In other words, as long as HlpLnClk is loaded you can click
an item within TSE's help line to execute the corresponding command.


2. Installation
---------------

Compile the macro and put the mac file into TSE's macro directory (on
default c:\os\mac). Next enter TSE editing an arbitrary file and add
HlpLnClk to the autoload list. Press <F10> <M> <A> to open the autoload
list. Then press <INS> and enter "hlplnclk". Now press <Enter> twice and
quit the editor. From now on, HlpLnClk will be loaded automatically
whenever you use TSE.


3. Usage
--------

Using HlpLnClk is very simple: Whenever you want to execute a command
displayed in the help line you can do so by simply clicking it with the
mouse. This also works for the commands displayed when you press any
combination of the shift (ctrl, alt) keys. Moreover, it also works for
any help line displayed by an interactive stand alone macro, as long as
the latter uses standard TSE keydefs to get its input. It doesn't work
with macros which define their own message loops and retrieve input via
GetKey (dialogs are an example for these kind of macros).

There is one limitation, though. HlpLnClk only understands helpline
entries which are of the format <key><dash><description>, e.g.

        F10-Menu

If HlpLnClk cannot figure out what the string you just clicked is all
about, it will beep and do nothing.
