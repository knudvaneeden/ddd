If you choose to install this in a file containing other procedures or macros
(e.g.) one of the startup macros you MUST place the code between the dashed
line *before* any other macro definition or procedure . In addition, replace
the "??" in the line beginning "binary '??:\..." with drive containing TSE.EXE
on your system.

Executing the macro will produce a small box with the question "New Directory"
You may enter any pathname or portion thereof in that box, including "\" and a
simple "x:" (to change drives).  A list of files in the new directory will be
displayed after the pathname is accepted.
