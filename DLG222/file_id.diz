The dialog macro package implements CUA style dialog boxes for
TSE. It features a run time library which implements the basic
behavior of dialog boxes. It also features ready to use dialogs
including FileOpen, Find, BufferList and many more. Version 2.22
fixes bugs and compatibility issues. Works with TSE Pro v2.5 and
TSE Pro/32 up to and including v4.2.
