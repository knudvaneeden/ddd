A Macro that displays the hexadecimal equivalent of a screen of binary
data.

    Features:

        o   Breaks up the display into convenient 16 byte chunks.
        o   Displays each line's starting hexadecimal address.
        o   Assigned to Alt H.
        o   Allows single byte hexadecimal editting(via Alt E).
        o   Includes H.BAT file which loads the binary file into the
            the editor in binary mode, sixteen bytes per line.

When H.BAT is executed with the appropriate binary file parameter,
TSE is invoked with HEXEDIT.MAC already loaded.  However, the hex-
adecimal display does not display until ALT H is pressed.  This
key combination acts as a toggle, and toggles hexadecimal mode on
and off.

Once toggled on, hexadecimal mode displays each line's sixteen byte
string to the right of the screen as the hexadecimal equivalent.
All keys function as normally, however, the cursor will 'shadow'
the appropriate hexadecimal byte to the right of the display.  The
cursor will not proceed past the last line on the screen.  In order
to proceed to the following page, use the PageUp key(conversely, to
proceed to a previous page, use the PageDown key).  This limitation
occurs only in hexadecimal mode.

   Example of Hexadecimal Mode:

-16 ASCII Bytes-    -Address- --------- Hexadecimal  Representation ---------

To edit a byte in hexadecimal mode, ALT E will process the current
byte, and display a message, position the cursor on the appropriate
hexadecimal 'byte', and prompt for hexadecimal entry.  If an invalid
hexadecimal entry is made, an error message will display, and the macro
will re-prompt for entry.  If a valid hexadecimal entry is made, the macro
will display the entered value, and the cursor will automatically position
at the following byte in the 16 ASCII Bytes display portion of the screen.

Finally, ALT G will prompt for a valid hexadecimal address, and will go to
that address.  If the Address entered is invalid, an error message will
display.  In this manner, large files can be easily updated.

This macro is presented 'as is'.  If you care to make any additions,
changes, etc., please do.  I only ask that if you do, please communicate
such changes to me, so that I may take advantage of them as well.
