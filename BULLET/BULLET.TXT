                                    BULLET.S
                   Bulleted list support for wordwrap macros.

        þ This macro adds bulleted list support to TSE.  It also helps
          wordwrap macros support bulleted lists so they don't trash
          bulleted lists.

        þ Just hit <Ctrl B> to access the handy bullet menu and select
          the bullet character you want to use.  If you're using
          WordWrap, the <Enter> key will automatically insert another
          bullet character, making bulleted lists a breeze!  If you use
          BULLET instead of WrapPara() when doing wordwrap, your
          bulleted lists will even get automatically indented!  And best
          of all, BULLET prevents wordwrap from destroying your bulleted
          lists.  It figures out the first and last lines of the bullet
          point you're editing and only wraps those lines.

        þ Also enclosed is a macro called AUTOWRAP.  This macro uses
          BULLET to wordwrap as you type, automatically adding a hanging
          indent to bulleted lists as you type.  You may need to remove
          another autowrap macro before loading AUTOWRAP, or you might
          even have to modify your .UI file to remove existing autowrap
          support.

        þ This macro is designed as a wrapper for your current wordwrap
          macro.  It's as easy as replacing the call to your wordwrap
          macro (or WrapLine() or WrapPara() command).  Anywhere you use
          WrapPara(), instead use ExecMacro("bullet -p").  Anywhere you
          use WrapLine(), instead use ExecMacro("bullet -l"). Anywhere
          you use ExecMacro("foo -x"), instead use ExecMacro("bullet
          foo -x").

        þ Keys:
            ù <Ctrl B> - Bullet menu
            ù <Enter> - Automatically continue a bulleted list (if
              WordWrap is ON or _AUTO_)
            ù NOTE:  To disable either the bullet menu or autobulleting,
              just set the corresponding #define to 0 in BULLET.S

        þ BULLET uses a Global String Variable to look up a list of
          valid bullet characters.  The name of the Global String
          Variable is "Bullets".  You can set the Bullets string in your
          .UI file, or BULLET will automatically set it with a default
          list of bullet characters if it is empty.  By changing the
          Bullets string, you can set what the legal bullet characters
          are.  You can also add new bullet characters to the bullet
          menu.

        þ Known goofiness:
            ù If you want to insert a blank line after a bullet point,
              you have to hit <Enter> twice, then go back and backspace
              over the bullet point you didn't want.
            ù In/Outdenting bullets is not automatic; you have to
              backspace over the bullet and insert a new bullet where
              you want it.
            ù In very rare cases, paragraph reformatting may not
              reformat a whole paragraph or bullet point.  This happens
              if a "-" or "*" (or other legal bullet character) ends up
              as the first character on a line in the paragraph/bullet
              point.

        þ Happy bulleting!
