/*****************************************************************************
   The macros and variables in LOPENFIX.S:
      - Cause a "beep" to sound whenever NextFile or PrevFile move you
        to the first file that was loaded
      - Change ListFiles so that the first file loaded is always at the
        top of the list
      - The procedure MakeFirst allows you to assign any file as the
        "first" file for the above

 NOTE:  This is not a stand-alone macro file.  At lease the global integer
        declaration and the OnFirstEdit procedure must be included in the
        User-Interface macro file.  I recommend including all of this,
        unless you desire the above effects only for certain editing
        purposes
