Improved Full-Justify macro for TSE 2.00
to replace the one that comes with TSE.
This version removes spaces added by previous
justify before rewrapping and rejustifying a
paragraph.  It is used as a substitute for
TSE's WrapPara() function.  Installation
instructions are given as comments in the
macro code.
