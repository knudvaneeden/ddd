Every once and awhile - I'm asked to provide a quote or estimate about how
long it will take and how much money it will cost to do some work
(programming, installation, etc)

What I do is to put together a work sheet (pencil and paper or
electronically) that identifies my concerns, work elements, etc. This work
sheet is then used to write the final quote. The problem that I have is that
the work sheet and the quote get physically separated, sometimes lost and
inconsistent.

So, I wrote PRWHITE.S. In military or government related businesses we have
WHITE Programs and BLACK Programs (ie, secret). PRWHITE stands for Print
White (or print the non-secret) portion of the document.

The BLACK or secret portion of the document are surrounded with '[[[' and
']]]'. PRWHITE skips these portions of the document during the printing
process.

So, here is an example...
Main Document --

The enhancement to the XYZ program will take 8 man weeks[[[ make sure they
know this is 8 weeks of work and not 8 weeks elapsed time ]]] of effort.

[[[
    * a lot of review will be required
    * be sure to talk to Sam Smith

    * poorly written program, no comments, poor variable names

    * review the current program     1.0 man weeks
    * implement the changes          5.0 man weeks
    * test                           1.0 man weeks
    * document                       0.5 man weeks
    * train and distribute           0.5 man weeks

    ** total                         8.0 man weeks

When you execute PRWHITE, you will be asked for Print Device and number of
copies. You can enter a filename for the Print Device.

I hope you find this useful
