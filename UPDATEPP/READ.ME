   This macro will add the macro descriptions from a source Potpourr.dat
   file to a destination Potpourr.dat file, overwriting duplicate
   descriptions.

   This macro might typically be used to update a local Potpourri
   from a server, not overwriting the user's private Potpourri
   descriptions.

   See the macro source for a more detailed description.

   This macro was tested with TSE Pro 2.50e an TSE Pro 2.80.

   Warning:
   It is even possible to copy descriptions between a Dos and a Windows
   Potpourr.dat file, but that is unwise, since both these versions
   have macroes, that might not exist in and be incompatible with the
   other version.
