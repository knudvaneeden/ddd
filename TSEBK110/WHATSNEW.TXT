³ What's New for TSEBOOK 1.10 º
ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

TSEBook can be added to your TSE User Interface in the Print Menu.  Due
to some changes in the ExecMacro() functionality between the initial
writing of TSEBook and the release of TSEPro 2.5, some changes in the
TSE.UI integration are necessary.  Unfortunately, I missed the need for
these changes in testing the 1.00 version for release.  See the TSEBook.DOC
file for more information.

Duplex page style is fully implemented in this release.

My thanks to Jim Miller, Robert Guyan, and George De Bruin for bringing
the integration and duplexing issues to my attention.  By way of thanks,
this release has been optimized and requires 50% less macro space.
