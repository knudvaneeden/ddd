BoxIt 0.11 -- 11/23/94.  This is a minor
revision of BoxIt to support TSE 2.0.
No new features have been added.  This
macro allows the user to draw a box
around a section of text marked with a
column block.  Changes in this version:
help removed, key assignments change to
not conflict with TSE 2.0's help system,
documentation updated.
