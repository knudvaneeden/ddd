A macro to expand a just-typed abbreviation
by offering choices of words (a) from an ab-
breviation list or (b) found in the current
document, whose beginning matches the abbre-
viation. 1 keystroke calls up the expansion,
then 'N' see other possibilities or any other
keystroke to insert it (and use that key-
stroke in your file.) For instance, type
'key<expandkey>s' right here and 'keystrokes'
would be in your file. Very inobtrusive!
