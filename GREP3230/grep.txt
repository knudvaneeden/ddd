GREP v3.0

Info ----------------------------------------------------------------------

GREP is a powerful facility to search files for a string.  You can
specify many different options to control the search.

Load the GREP macro, or add it to your AutoLoad list.  Hit <Alt G> to
bring up the main dialog box.  From there, <F1> gives help.


Some hilights include:

    ù NEW!  Performs searches in the background so you can continue
      editing during long searches.

    ù A context window shows matching lines as they appear in the
      context of the file they come from.  (on TSE 2.6, the context
      window is scrollable using <Ctrl Up/Down>)

    ù Almost everything but the kitchen sink - see the help file for
      more info.

    ù Works on TSE 2.6, 2.8, 3.0, and 4.0.


It does NOT:

    ù Allow searching for a string that spans multiple lines.

    ù Support proximity searches (eg, find "foo" near "bar").



Unzip ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unzip the contents of the .ZIP file into your MAC\ directory, and load
the GREP macro.  You're set to go!



Requirements --------------------------------------------------------------

ù Dieter Koessl's Dialog system (dialog.mac and dialogp.mac), which is
  included in the ZIP file.

ù GETHELP.MAC, which is also included in the ZIP file.  For the full
  version of the GETHELP macro, along with extra help files that
  supplement the built-in TSE help, look for GETHLP*.ZIP at
  ftp:ftp.semware.com/TSE-Pro.



History -------------------------------------------------------------------

v3.0:

ù Tons of optimizations and minor bug fixes.

ù Searches across deep nested directories will be MUCH faster now.

ù <Ctrl CursorLeft> and <Ctrl CursorRight> scroll the context window
  horizontally.


v2.5:

ù Searches in the background so you can continue editing during long
  searches (or you can peruse the search results as the search
  progresses)!  You can terminate a search by pressing <Ctrl C> while
  you're viewing the search results window.


v2.2:

ù Improved the "Search for:" prompt so you toggle -i, -x, and -w
  options by hitting <Ctrl I/X/W>.

ù Context window has meter on the right side showing roughly where it is
  looking in the file.

ù Fixed bug where searching for "path1\*.* path2\*.*" did not work.


v2.1:

ù Forgot to include the help file in earlier releases.  Also forgot to
  include the batch file for using GREP from the DOS prompt.  Both are
  included in this release.

ù This is the last planned release of this GREP macro for DOS TSE 2.5.
  The macro will continue to gain new and exciting superhuman powers on
  TSE 2.6 and new versions of TSE, but I regret to say it just takes too
  much work to keep it working on DOS TSE, since the macro has gotten so
  darn big.  With some of the latest new features, it took almost two
  hours to trim the thing down so it was small enough to run on DOS TSE
  (we're talking two hours to trim off only 200 bytes!  It's not worth
  it to me).  As a result, some new features just couldn't fit into the
  DOS version.

ù The context window shows the name of the function that contains the
  matching line, if the file is a programming language source code file!
  (Note, it's not 100% accurate, but it's close)

ù <F5> refreshes the results list (does the whole search again).

ù Long filenames are supported, but long filenames with spaces cannot be
  used for "Files to search" or "Files to exclude", not even if you use
  quotes.  [TSE 2.6 only]

ù <Alt L> loads all files with matches.  [TSE 2.6 only]

ù <Alt Left> and <Alt Right> let you browse the 10 most recent results
  lists, similar to Internet Explorer's Back/Forward commands that let
  you view web pages you've visited recently.  [TSE 2.6 only]

ù Bug fixes for TSE 2.5 version:
    ù now works correctly from Potpourri menu.
    ù one user reported files being missed by the search; this has been
      fixed (technical info: I was missing a SetDTA command).
    ù misc other minor fixes.
