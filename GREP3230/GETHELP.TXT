Release Notes:

v4.0, 05/19/02
-

v2.8a, 05/06/98
- uses undocumented HELPHELP.MAC to handle F1 while in TSE menus.
- detects ( or () and looks for the word before them.
- Ctrl-V isn't overridden anymore (to avoid conflicting with the Paste
  command).
- TOO BIG FOR TSE 2.5, abandoning support for TSE 2.5 (sorry).

v2.8, 06/26/97
- support TSE 2.8.

v2.1, 03/27/97
- minor changes to help files.
- when linking to a subtopic, the subtopic is always displayed at the top of
  the screen.

v2.0:
- various fixes.
- the help file for GetHelp is complete.

v1.01:
- NEW: <Alt P> prints out the current help topic.
- The supplementary help files now include a Table of Contents in
  book-like format; now you can read the online TSE help as though it
  were a printed manual.
- My apologies for my lousy testing on TSE 2.5!  I'm using TSE 2.6
  exclusively, and I discovered several bugs using GetHelp with TSE 2.5.
  This time I tried to test it pretty exhaustively on TSE 2.5;
  everything should work fine in this version.

v1.00:
- My apologies to TSE 2.5 users who noticed the file ini.si was missing
  in a previous release -- the file is no longer needed.
- My apologies for the previous release not compiling at all on TSE 2.5,
  plus other various bugs.
- The previous releases of GETHELP had such a large keydef that an error
  often occurred when loading GETHELP, or when loading another macro
  after loading GETHELP.  The error message was "KeyBoard table full".
  This has been fixed.  You might still get that error, but if you do
  then you must have a lot of macros loaded!!



-- Setting up GETHELP --------------------------------------------------------

        GETHELP comes pre-compiled for TSE 4.0, but can be recompiled
        for TSE 2.6 through 4.0.



Instructions for TSE 2.6 thru TSE 4.0:

        1. Unzip GETHELP.ZIP to your MAC\ directory.
        2. Move GETHELP.DAT and HELP*.HLP to your main TSE directory.
        3. Compile the macros by running these DOS prompt commands:
           - Run the DOS prompt command "sc32 gethelp.si".
           - Run the DOS prompt command "sc32 helphelp.s".
        4. Add GETHELP.MAC to your AutoLoad list:
           - Start TSE
           - Go to the main menu, choose the "Macro" menu
           - Choose "AutoLoad List..."
           - Press <Ins>
           - Type "GETHELP" and press <Enter> (without entering the
             quotation marks)
           - Press <Enter> to close the AutoLoad List
        5. See "Using GETHELP", below.



Instructions for TSE 2.5 (DOS):

        SORRY:  Download GETHLP20.ZIP instead from ftp.semware.com.



-- Using GETHELP -------------------------------------------------------------

HINT:   For help on using GETHELP, just execute the GETHELP.MAC macro,
        and the "Welcome to GETHELP" help topic will automatically
        appear.

        Or, load the GETHELP macro, and press <Ctrl F1>, then select
        "Help on GETHELP" from the menu.



Quick Summary of Keys:

        <F1>             Context sensitive help based on file extension.
        <Shift F1>       Show syntax window.
        <Ctrl F1>        Full help menu.

        To configure the list of help files, hit <Ctrl F1>, then hit
        <Alt E>.



NEW:    You can now add Windows help files, TSE help files, or help
        programs (such as 4help.exe that comes with 4DOS) to the help
        menu!  Hit F1 and depending on the extension of the file you're
        editing, you get a menu of the available help files for that
        extension.  (If there's only one help file for that extension,
        it just goes straight to the help file w/o showing a menu).  To
        add/remove help files, hit <Ctrl F1>, then <Alt E>.



-- Advanced Users ------------------------------------------------------------

        - See GETHELP.SI for technical information, and command line
          parameters for the macro.  (Or press <Ctrl F1>, then <F1>,
          then <Alt I>, then select "Command Line Options for GETHELP
          Macro")

        - You can use GETHELP to show help files for your own macros!
          Look at the "MyHelp" procedure in GETHELP.SI for an example of
          how to connect it up.
