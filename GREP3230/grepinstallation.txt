Latest instructions:

1. -Tested successfully in a clean TSE version 4.42

2. -It did not work in my working TSE version 4.42 (probable cause .UI differences)

3. -It is not mandatory to go to your mac directory,

4. -You can choose an arbitrary directory. E.g. c:\TEMP\

5. -Goto an arbitrary directory

     c:\TEMP\

6. -Create a directory grep there

     md grep

7. -Copy and unzip the 4 below zip files into this grep directory
    (unzip these 4 .zip files mandatory in this order from top to bottom)

     pkunzipc -extract -dir grep3230.zip

     pkunzipc -extract -dir dlg222.zip

     pkunzipc -extract -dir gethlp40.zip

     pkunzipc -extract -dir dlg222p.zip

    -Note: When asked to overwrite the dialog.si file when
           unzipping 'dlg222.zip' answer thus 'YES' (that is
           important, otherwise you get missing variables
           errors 2 times later when compiling the .s and
           .si)

            Error   2335  (497,32)   Undefined symbol 'DlgMsgText' encountered

           Answer 'Yes' when asking to over write 'guiinc.inc'

           If asked to delete the .mac files, that is not so important
           as they will be overwritten anyhow in the next steps.

8. -Then create and run this build.bat file to compile (only) these
    4 files (if you should compile more files than you will get one or more errors).

sc32 dialog.s
sc32 dialogp.s
sc32 gethelp.si
sc32 grep.s

9. -Make sure there are no errors from this compiling.

10. Then start TSE and run that latest 'grep.mac' in that grep directory.

11. You should see a Dieter Koessl dialog box to fill in and run Chris Antos' grep.
