<05-15-02> v3.0 - GREP macro for TSE Pro/32.
Works with v4.0 (both the console and the GUI
versions), v3.0, v2.8, and v2.6.  To try it
out, load the GREP macro or add it to your
AutoLoad list.  Hit <Alt G> to bring up the
main dialog box, then hit <F1> to see the
help file.  The help file is lame, but should
be good enough to get you started.  The GREP
macro can search files in the BACKGROUND,
while you continue to work (hit <Esc> to
continue working; it will beep when it's
finished, or at any time hit <AltShift G> to
display the GREP result list).
