1. Overview
-----------

DlgWOpen is a Windows 95 replacement for the DlgOpen dialog which is
distributed with the dialogs macro package. It allows you to load and save
files using long names while running TSE in a DOS session in Windows 95.
The dialogs macro package version 1.20 is necessary both to compile and and
run DlgWOpen.


2. Installation
---------------

Copy all the DlgWOpen files to the directory where you stored the dialogs
source files, e.g.

        copy dlgwo*.* dlg_path

Now go to that directory and compile the dialog, e.g.

        cd dlg_path
        sc dlgwopen

Finally, copy the compiled macro to a place where TSE can find it, e.g.

        copy dlgwopen.mac c:\tse\mac

DlgWOpen is now ready to use.

If you have previously installed DlgOpen within your burned in UI or even
use DLG.UI from the dialogs macro package you should change some of the
references to DlgOpen within your UI to DlgWOpen. Load your UI file into
TSE and search for the string "dlgopen". You should change "dlgopen" to
"dlgwopen" within the ExecMacro calls, if no command line switch is present
or if it is one of the following: -s, -i or -b. Don't touch the other calls,
e.g. the switches -l, -v and -k, since DlgWOpen does not understand them and
you must still use the old DlgOpen to load/save SAL and KBD macros. (This
means that you cannot use long filenames for SAL macros and to store
recorded keyboard macros.)


3. Using DlgWOpen
-----------------

This shouldn't be much of a problem, if you have worked with Windows 95 any
length of time, since DlgWOpen goes a long way to emulate the new Open File
dialog which is commonly used in Windows 95. DlgWOpen also includes a
(hopefully) comprehensive on-line help which explains the hot keys and other
features of the dialog. The command line switches of DlgWOpen do the
following

        none    EditFile
        -s      SaveFileAs
        -i      InsertBlock
        -b      SaveBlock
        -f      list only files (don't list folders)
        -n      list only names (don't list file date/time and file size)

The settings of the -f and -n switches can still be changed when DlgWOpen is
already executing using the options dialog.


4. Dos Mode
-----------

What happens, if you use TSE in DOS mode? Well, nothing you have to concern
yourself about. DlgWOpen detects DOS mode (and old DOS versions) and
automatically calls DlgOpen as a replacement instead.


5. Limitations
--------------

DlgWOpen uses SAL strings to store path names, e.g. the longest path it can
handle is 254 characters long. On the other hand, Windows 95 allows path
names which are up to 260 characters long. This means that you MUST NOT use
path names which exceed the limit imposed by DlgWOpen or the macro will fail
utterly most probably hanging TSE. The dialog library imposes another limit
yet. The maximum length of the text within an edit control is 128 characters
which limits the size of the filenames you can use.

Well, I guess that in real life these aren't limits at all, since nobody
actually will use filenames _that_ long.
