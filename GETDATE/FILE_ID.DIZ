<03-31-94> Date macro -  TSE Pro, TSE Pro/32
Macro which pops up a small window with the
system date, and allows the user to easily
change the date, and insert the desired date
into text at the location of the cursor. The
possibly unique aspect of the macro is that
it 'knows' the day of the week of the
particular date chosen. After the date to be
inserted is selected, a second menu pops up
listing several date formats to choose from,
some of which include the day of the week.
The chosen format is inserted into the text.
