This package contains a high-bit character conversion macro for the most
common character conversion problems, allowing you to convert among the
following formats:

     DOS - ANSI/ISO
     DOS - HP ROMAN-8
     DOS - MACINTOSH
     ANSI/ISO - MACINTOSH

It also includes a generic paragraph unwrap macro for use when preparing a

purpose can be found in DOCMODE.ZIP.)
