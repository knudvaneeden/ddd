Archiver 0.9.6 (Aug 9, 2002):

System for creating incremental backups (file.000, file.001,
etc.).

It will optionally store all backups in a central
repository, maintaining a complete directory hierarchy
containing incremental backups of every file you have
edited, keeping up to 1000 of the most recent versions
of each file.


Platform: TSE Pro 2.x/3.x/4.x

Requirements: The DOS version of TSE needs the 'Profile' package.
