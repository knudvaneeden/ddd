The TIMER.INC file can be included in your macros to provide fast,
simple binary timing functions.  The timing functions are implemented
completed in SAL using Semware's INTR.INC and INTR.BIN (which must
be available to compile TICKTIMR.

DOS maintains a counter of the 'clock ticks' (about 1.57 million per
day or 18.2 per second) since midnight.  The value of the tick timer
can be used as a 32 bit timestamp with 0.05 second precision.  Some
high resolution timer routines change the tick frequency.  These macros
do not.

The primary usefulness of these macros are timestamps for event logging
and duration calulations.  This could be accomplished through converting
the DOS Hr, Min, Sec, Sec100 values; however, using the timestamp is
much simpler and faster.  Since the system clock is updated on the same
frequency as the system timer, it is as precise as the DOS time.

The approach with these macros has been to stick within integer
limitations and as a result, there are 31 bit limitations involved in
the conversion calculations that force trade offs between range and
precision.  TicksToMs is slanted toward resolution, whereas
TicksToSeconds is slanted toward higher range.


   These macros are in 'test mode'.  While I know of no problems, use
   them at your own risk.  And in the words of Mikhail Gorbachev:
                       "Trust -- but verify."
