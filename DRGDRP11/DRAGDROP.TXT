             (This version of DRAGDROP works on both TSE 2.5 and
            TSE 2.6, comes with DRAGDROP.MAC compiled for TSE 2.6;
                 recompile the macro to use it with TSE 2.5)



            This macro provides mouse selection and drag-drop support
        that is similar to Microsoft Word for Windows.  You are free to
        modify, customize, distribute, and delete this macro.  Just
        don't sell it.  It's free.

            You can add it to your TSE AutoLoad List to make it active
        every time you start TSE.  If you use some key other than
        <Escape> to call your MainMenu(), then you should change the
        constant MAINMENU_KEY at the beginning of DRAGDROP.S to whatever
        your key is.


        === Using DRAGDROP.MAC =========================================

            If you execute DRAGDROP.MAC, it will display a short help
        screen explaining how to use it.  If you just load DRAGDROP.MAC
        (or add it to your AutoLoad List) it will not display the help
        screen.  If you want to be able to show the help screen by
        pressing a key, change the HELP_SCREEN_KEY at the beginning of
        DRAGDROP.S to whatever key you want to use.


        --- Selection: -------------------------------------------------

            Clicking the left button outside of any windows brings up
        the main menu.  Clicking the left button in the current window
        moves the cursor there.  Clicking the left button in a window
        other than the current window makes that window the current
        window (holding the button will move the cursor there, too).
        Click and hold the left button in the current window to mark the
        word under the mouse cursor.

            Shift-clicking the left button in a window will make that
        window the current window and also move the cursor there.

            Click and drag to select a character block.  Ctrl-click and
        drag to select a column block.  To select a line block,
        doubleclick and drag, or Alt-click and drag.


        --- Drag and drop: ---------------------------------------------

            To drag-drop a selected block, click on it and begin
        dragging.  To abort the drag, press <Escape>.  If you do not
        abort the drag, then when you release the mouse button, the
        block will be moved to wherever the mouse cursor is.  If you
        hold down the <Ctrl> key, then the block will be copied (instead
        of moved).  If you hold down the <Alt> key and the block is a
        column block, it will be moved/copied over the text at the
        destination (see CopyBlock(_OVERWRITE_) in the TSE help file for
        more information).  You can drag and drop between windows, even!

            To change files while dragging, hit <Alt-,> (previous file)
        or <Alt-.> (next file).  (But make sure you don't let go of the
        mouse button).


        === Caveats ====================================================

            To minimize the configuration necessary to use this macro, I
        made it use the MouseRepeatDelay variable to determine the delay
        while scrolling.  There is a simple proc mDelay which tries to
        emulate the TSE internal delay routine; I'm running on a
        Pentium-90, and I timed the delay scrolling through a huge file
        (it took over a minute) and my routine was only off by 2 seconds
        from TSE's internal routine.  I tried it on my 386-33, and it
        performed well, too, but your mileage may vary.  Feel free to
        modify the mDelay routine to fine-tune the actual delay.  Or
        just use a constant delay value instead of MouseRepeatDelay.

        	Drag-scrolling only works on boxed (bordered) edges of
        windows.  So if you happen to have DisplayBoxed set to 0 (or 1
        but UseMouse is 0 or MouseEnabled is 0), drag-scrolling will not
        work on some edges of windows.  This was a design decision to
        improve drag-scrolling performance.  I fixed it once, but
        decided it ran too slowly and ripped out the fix.


        === Bonus ======================================================

            Near the bottom of DRAGDROP.S, I list a few undocumented
        keys I've found that TSE recognizes.  You can bind commands to
        them, etc.


        === Enjoy! =====================================================
