Put mswheel.mac and mswheel.s in the tse32\mac directory.
Put mswheel.dll in the tse32 directory.

To use the macro, simply load it.

To configure it, execute the macro, passing -menu as a parameter
to the macro.  e.g., From a "Execute macro:" prompt, type:

mswheel -menu    <return>

To have it available all the time, add it to the autoload list.


The AutoLoadList Command

You may wish to have certain external Compiled Macro files loaded
automatically each time you start the editor.  To accomplish this, you can
maintain a list of those macro files in a special autoload file, named
TSELOAD.DAT, using the AutoLoadList command.


þ AutoLoadList  ("AutoLoad List" under Macro Menu)

  This command allows you to maintain a list of external Compiled Macro files
  to be automatically loaded on editor startup.  When you execute this
  command, the editor displays the current list of macro files in the autoload
  file (TSELOAD.DAT).  Press <Ins> to add a macro file to the list; press
  <Del> on an entry to delete it from this list.

To add a new macro file to the autoload list, execute AutoLoadList.  Once the
current list of macro files is displayed, position the cursor bar on the
existing macro filename after which you want the new macro file to be loaded.
Then press <Ins>.  The editor issues the prompt, "Macro filename:", for the
name of the macro file you want to add.  Enter the name of the Compiled Macro
file, including any necessary path information. The editor assumes an
extension of ".MAC", so it is not necessary to enter the extension.  When
your response is complete, press <Enter>.  The editor then updates the
autoload file to include the indicated macro file.

To remove a macro file from the autoload list, move the cursor bar to the
macro file entry in the list, and press <Del>.  The editor prompts you to
confirm that you want to delete that macro file.  Upon your confirmation, the
editor removes that macro file from the autoload list.

The autoload file, TSELOAD.DAT, is maintained in the editor load directory.
The macro files included in this file are automatically loaded each time you
start the editor.  The editor loads the macro files, in the order in which
they are listed, by issuing the LoadMacro command for each macro file.  If
path information is included as part of a macro file entry, the editor
searches for that macro file in the indicated directory when it attempts to
load it.  If path information is not included in the entry, the editor
successively searches directories according to the "macro file search order"
described in an earlier section, "Creating and Using Compiled Macros."  For
any macro file that the editor cannot locate, the editor skips any further
processing of that file, and attempts to load the next macro file in the list.
