                                   ==========

        HexOfs.Mac shows you the offset of the cursor when you're in
        BinaryMode.  On the right end of the status line, HexOfs.Mac
        displays the file offset of the current cursor position.  It
        displays the offset in either hex or decimal.  To toggle between
        hex and decimal, hit Ctrl-Shift-Enter.  To jump to a specific
        offset, hit Ctrl-Enter and type in the offset, in either hex or
        decimal (yep, whichever base you're currently displaying the
        offset in -- don't worry, the prompt reminds you which mode
        you're in).

        You change the key bindings by editing HexOfs.S, of course.

        The keys are set up so in BinaryMode they override whatever
        function they were already bound to.  When not in BinaryMode,
        they work just like however you already had them set up.  Since
        HexOfs.Mac is so inobtrusive, I recommend sticking it in your
        AutoLoad list.

        KNOWN PROBLEMS: HexOfs assumes each line is the same length
        (this is how BinaryMode works).  However, if you edit some line
        so that it is longer or shorter than how long TSE thinks each
        line should be, then HexOfs will not be able to calculate the
        offset correctly.  Solution: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN EDITING BINARY
        FILES!

        Enjoy!
