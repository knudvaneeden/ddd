PerlMod v0.9.3 (Jun 19, 2002):


Allows you to edit or view the docs for a Perl module by
name (e.g. Apache::Session, Net::FTP).

The name is picked up from the current line in the
file you are editing, so all you have to do is move
the cursor to a 'use' or 'package' statement in your
Perl program and press a key to edit or view the
module!

For editing, it will search for the module in
a list of module directories on your system.

To view the docs for a module it will launch
your web browser and navigate to the documentation
on http://www.perldoc.com/ by default, although
this also can be configured.

Also included is a simple Perl CGI script
that you can install on your own web server
to view documentation for the modules you have
installed on that system.


Platform: TSE Pro 2.x/3.x/4.x

Requirements: The DOS version of TSE needs the 'Profile' package.
