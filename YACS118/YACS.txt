    YACS - Yet Another Commenting System

    1. INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    This is a simple commenting system for all programming
    languages that use line-based comments.

    It has the following features:

        * Automatically uses the correct comment string
          for the type of file you are editing.

        * Lets you comment or uncomment the current line (toggle).

        * Lets you comment or uncomment a block.

        * Automatically puts the comment at the *end* of the current
          line, if your cursor is beyond the EOL.

        * When you press enter on a commented line, the next
          line automatically starts off commented.

        * When you join lines by deleting the last character of a line
          and both lines are commented, the comment string on the
          joined line is automatically removed.

        * When you wordwrap a commented paragraph, the comments
          are protected, and don't get mixed up with the text.

    All of the above features use either standard editing keys (e.g.
    pressing <Enter> to continue a comment), or the single magic
    comment toggle key. I use <ctrl n>, but that's just me.

    The point is, the system is designed to be simple.  Only one new
    keystroke to learn, but there are a lot of subtle features and
    behaviours to explore.  Some of these subtle behaviours were
    even intended by the author!

    So it's best to install the package and learn how to use it.

    Aside from the comment toggle key, there is one more small
    but useful feature worthy of note:

        Comment and Duplicate

    This feature allows you to perform two actions at once:  duplicate
    a block, and comment out the first copy.

    This turns:

        X = (F *)malloc(N * (O(A)>O(F)?O(A):O(F)) * 2);
        if(!X) { printf("No memory\n"); exit(-1); }
        U(K,N) fscanf(W,"%f",X+K);
        fclose(W);

    Into the following:

        // X = (F *)malloc(N * (O(A)>O(F)?O(A):O(F)) * 2);
        // if(!X) { printf("No memory\n"); exit(-1); }
        // U(K,N) fscanf(W,"%f",X+K);
        // fclose(W);

        X = (F *)malloc(N * (O(A)>O(F)?O(A):O(F)) * 2);
        if(!X) { printf("No memory\n"); exit(-1); }
        U(K,N) fscanf(W,"%f",X+K);
        fclose(W);

    This allows you to preserve a commented copy of the dangerous code
    you are about to hack around in.

    (BTW, the above was chosen from Alan De Smet's 1998 Obfuscated
    C-Code entry which apparently won the prize for Best Object
    Orientation.  I do NOT recommend running this code).

    2. INSTALLATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE: On TSE 2.5 (DOS) You will first need to install the Profile
    package.  See Profile.txt in that package for instructions.

    Place the YACS.s, findprof.si, setcache.si and pcache.si files
    in your macro source directory.

    Note that the findprof.si, setcache.si and pcache.si files may
    already have been installed from another macro package. If so, you
    should not need to install them again.  But it's worth taking a
    quick check to see that you have the latest version of these files.

    You will probably want to edit the keydefs at the end of YACS.s
    so that they match your preferences.  There are comments in the
    source to help guide you.

    Finally, compile YACS.s!

    In order to make YACS always use the right comment character for your
    file type, you will have to configure it by editing TSE.INI.  See below
    under CONFIGURATION.

    You may also want to install the CurrExt package, which will make
    configuring YACS easier.  See the blatent plug in the CONFIGURATION
    section, below.

    If you do install the CurrExt package, note that the order in which
    YACS and CurrExt appear in TSE's autoload list is important.  Please
    see the INSTALLATION section of the CurrExt documentation for
    details.

    3. CONFIGURATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    YACS reads its settings from TSE.INI.  (It searches for this file
    according to the rules in the FindProf package.)  YACS uses the
    [YACS] and [YACS_Comment_Strings] sections in TSE.INI.

    The [YACS_Comment_Strings] section is the most important. Here, you
    tell YACS which comment strings to use for which type of file.
    The left hand side is the file extension (without the dot) and the
    right hand side is the comment character.  For example:

        [YACS_Comment_Strings]
        pl=#
        php=//
        ini=;
        s=//
        c=//
        prg=//
        pas=//
        bat=REM

    In this case, DOS batch files (.bat) would use 'REM' as their
    comment character while Semware SAL macro files (.s) would use '//'.

    <plug>
    It is much easier to edit and maintain the YACS configuration
    information when you are also using the optional CurrExt package.
    This package lets you map a number of file extensions to a single file
    type.  For instance, you can tell CurrExt that files ending in
    '.pl', '.cgi', '.pm', and '.ph' are all type 'pl' (Perl source
    files), and then you can simply tell YACS that the comment string
    for 'pl' files is '#'; and that string will now work for files
    ending in any of those extensions.

    To make sure that CurrExt and YACS can peacefully coexist,
    please be sure to read the CurrExt INSTALLATION instructions.
    </plug>

    There is one more setting, and that is in the [YACS] section, there is
    only one setting:

        [YACS]
        blank_before_duplicate = 1

    This setting tells YACS whether or not to put a blank line between
    the commented and uncommented copies of a block when using the
    CommentAndDuplicate() function.

    YACS will use the SetCache package if you have it installed.
    This means you can tell it to reload its settings without exiting it
    and restarting.  To do so, Edit TSE.INI, and then run the SReload macro.

    v1.1.8 - Jun 19, 2002

    Originally loosely based on John D. Goodman's wonderful I_CMMT.S
    package (version 1.0), which I used for many years.  But recently
    I rewrote it more or less from scratch, removing the bits I never
    used and including all the features I have added over the years. I
    don't think any significant pieces of I_CMMT code survived the
    rewrite.
