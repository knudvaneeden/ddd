/*

By request, I have added some special support for blind users.  This
includes:

	ù clicking while spell checking so you can tell that DSpell is making
	  progress through the file, higher pitched beep when done.
	ù all prompt boxes are positioned in the upper left corner, instead of
	  near the cursor.

To enable the special support for blind users, #define BLIND, then recompile
all DSpell source files.
