
   The format of HIREXP.DAT is as follows,
   without the slashes and starting on column 1:

/     [.extension1 .extension2 .extension3 ...]
/     1122 33 ...regexp1options1regexp2options2 ...
/     4455 66 ...regexp3options3regexp4options4 ...
/     ...
/     [.extension4 .extension5 ...]
/     7788 99 ...regexp5options5regexp6options6 ...
/     ...

   Where:

      .extensension  At least one extension between the [] for which the
                     lines following apply.

                     Use a point followed by a space to indicate
                     extensionless files.

      11             Mandatory hexadecimal color code that indicates the
                     color to use if the regular exressions succeed.

                     This is the same hexadecimal code shown by TSE when
                     you are changing colors: there you can look it up.

      22 33 ...      Optional hexadecimal color codes that indicate the
                     colors under the cursor not to recolor when the regular
                     expressions succeed.

                     This is for instance usefull for not recoloring
                     commented text: for this parameter you use the
                     hexadecimal color codes of the comment colors.

      regexp         The first regular expression on the line is mandatory,
                     the rest is optional.

                     Do not use delimiters other than the hearts.

                     Only if all regular expressions in a line succeed,
                     then the last found text is recolored.

      option         All options are optional. The default is "ix".

                     The "c" option is never necessary, because here ALL
                     searches are are limited to a line.

                     Before the first regular expression the "cursor" is set
                     to the begin of each line, so the "g" option is also not
                     necessary.

                     If the "g" option is omitted, then an attempt is made
                     to find multiple occurrences of the same string within
                     one line, otherwise just the first occurrence will be
                     found.

                     From the second regular expression onwards it is
                     possible to use the ">" in your options: this means to
                     start searching after the string found by the previous
                     regular expression.

                    This delimiter is mandatory between parameters,
                     especially when an optional parameter is omitted and
                     more not-empty parameters are following.

                     A heart delimter after the last parameter is optional.



   Note: Lines without at least two hearts and lines before the first
         extensions indicator are treated as comments in this file.
