<05-29-98> Macro for TSE Pro/32 v2.8.
Syntax-hilite regular expressions.  This
macro (for 32-bit versions of TSE Pro only)
allows you to color parts of each screen line
based on: 1) the current file extension, 2)
the current comment colors (by NOT recoloring
them), and 3) multiple regular expressions.
