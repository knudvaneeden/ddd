Welcome ...
------------

Here's the SAL version of SOKOBAN - I did this mainly to learn more about 
SAL, and I liked what I learned. This archive contains SOKO.S, 50 level 
files named LEVEL.01 to LEVEL.50, and this documentation file.


The aim of the game
-------------------

In the unlikely case you never heard of SOKOBAN, the aim of the game is 
simple: move all stars (*) to the storage positions (ú), by pushing them 
with the 'actor' (). You may only push, not pull them, and only one at a 
time. When you push a star onto a storage position, it will change its aspect
from '*' to ''. (N.B. Your actor will also look different on a storage 
position: it changes its aspect from  to )

         
Compiling the macro
-------------------

You can either compile SOKO.S from the commandline, using

   SC SOKO.S

or from within TSE: load SOKO.S into the editor, and hit Ctrl-F9 to compile
it. When asked whether to Execute or Load the macro, select Load.


Playing
-------

To play, load one of the level files (start with LEVEL.01) into TSE and hit 
Ctrl-X, then specify SOKO. The macro will switch to 'SOKOBAN Mode' and 
position the cursor on the actor - just move it with the cursor keys.

To exit SOKOBAN mode at any time, hit ESC. To resume playing, launch the 
macro again (repeat the above procedure). When you solved a level, the macro
will automatically quit SOKOBAN mode.


Tips, Room for improvement
--------------------------

To save the state of a level that you haven't completely solved, just save 
the file. I suggest you keep a copy of the distribution archive so that you 
can later go back to the original levels. There's much room for improvement
in the current version of this macro. Automatic loading of the next level
could be added, as well as a 'save status' and 'restore status' key or even 
a genuine 'undo' feature. The SAL programming itself can probably also stand 
some improvement - this is my first try at anything nontrivial in SAL, and 
some of the workarounds are less than elegant. Feel free to improve and 
enhance, and please share whatever you come up with.
