Concerning the problem (when running TSE Pro/32) of when a typed character 
is the "opposite" case of what the keyboard CAPSLOCK light indicates it
should be:

If you are running WIN95 OSR2 or WIN98, AND CAPSLOCK is ON
at the time you start-up a command prompt (which you then run e32.exe
from) or you start the editor via a shortcut when CAPSLOCK is on,
you will get this behavior in e32.exe (with these versions of the OS,
MS introduced a bug into the API calls we access to read the 
keyboard).  Note that if CAPSLOCK is OFF BEFORE you start the command
line session or activate the shortcut, all will work fine and as expected.

If you are running WIN95 OSR2 or WIN98, then copy fixcap.s and fixcap.mac
into your TSE Pro/32's MACRO directory, and then add  FIXCAP  to your
autoload macro list.

See the beginning of the fixcap.s file for a full explanation of the problem
and the workaround.
