(07-07-99) - Helper macro for TSE Pro/32 v2.x
Concerning the problem (when running TSE
Pro/32) of when a typed character is the
"opposite" case of what the keyboard CAPSLOCK
light indicates it should be:

If you are running WIN95 OSR2 or WIN98, AND
CAPSLOCK is ON at the time you start-up a
command prompt (which you then run e32.exe
from) or you start the editor via a shortcut
when CAPSLOCK is on, you will get this
behavior in e32.exe (with these versions of
the OS, MS introduced a bug into the API
calls we access to read the keyboard).  Note
that if CAPSLOCK is OFF BEFORE you start the
command line session or activate the
shortcut, all will work fine and as expected.
without needing this macro.
See the read.me file for instructions.
