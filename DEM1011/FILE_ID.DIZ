dem.s - Designer Enclosures - Version 1
Revision 11 - a macro written with TSE-PRO
GUI 4.0. This macro provides the convenience
of surrounding text with several standard
enclosure sets, like double/single quotes,
brackets, etc., as well as custom designed
enclosure sets that you can choose from an
ASCII chart, or type in manually (see the
help screen). You can put these enclosures
around all lines in a file, all lines in a
line-block, or on the left-right boundaries
of a column block. You can also select
whether to enclose blank lines. Great for
doing columns of data. Contact the author or
