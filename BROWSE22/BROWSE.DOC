BROWSE makes The SemWare Editor a brawny clone of Vern Buerg's text reader
"LIST Plus".  You can switch between BROWSE and edit modes instantaneously.


Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   *** If updating from a previous version, see following section. ***

   The size of this macro (almost 16k when compiled with the supplied help
   and keys) almost demands that it be loaded and executed as an *external*
   macro, and I have written it with that method of use in mind.

   1) Place the following files in your user macro (or TSE macro) directory:

       a) browse.s
       b) browse.ini
       c) browse.key
       d) browse.hlp

   2) Compile BROWSE.S with SC (from DOS or from within TSE).

      After compiling, you only need BROWSE.MAC and BROWSE.INI to run
      BROWSE.  You can delete BROWSE.S, BROWSE.KEY and BROWSE.HLP.

   3) To run BROWSE from the command line, use either of these methods:

      a) e -eBROWSE
      b) e filename -eBROWSE

   4) If you also want to bind BROWSE to a keystroke, you have two options:

      a) Put something like the following line in your key assignments:

         <Ctrl b>   ExecMacro('browse')  // View file - don't edit it!

      b) If you want a prompt to confirm switching to BROWSE mode, then:

        i) Copy the "BROWSE.SI" file to your TSE\UI directory.

        ii) Put the following line in your .UI file, before your key
           assignments:

           #include ["browse.si"]      // Macro to prompt for BROWSE mode

        iii) Edit the key assignment in "browse.si" if desired.

   5) If you have made any changes to your UI file, then burn the changes
      into your editor (Example: sc -b c:\tse\ui\tse.ui).


Updating from a previous version:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1) Rename your current BROWSE.INI to BROWSEold.INI.

   2) Extract the necessary BROWSE.* files to your preferred directory,
      as explained above.

   3) Edit the variable settings in the new BROWSE.INI to match
      your previous settings.  Delete BROWSEold.INI.

   4) Follow steps 2 through 5 under "Installation" above.

   5) Start BROWSE, and then press <Ctrl O> to verify your options.


Background:
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The key assignments are nearly 100% identical to those in LIST, both in
   function and behavior.  Use the online help (F1) for QuickHelp().

   My comments in BROWSE.S are not extensive, but between the LIST docs and
   the brief notes in the QuickHelp(), I hope that the documentation is, at
   least, adequate.

   Although I didn't even attempt a file-manager mode of BROWSE, the only
   view-mode functions of LIST that I did not duplicate are the various text
   filters, and a couple of things which are either irrelevant in TSE or
   which TSE handles automatically (e.g. preloading & keyahead).


Technical concerns:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I've tried to avoid changing colors when the COLORS macro is loaded, but
   I do apologize if I missed something.  Please tell me if I erred!

   Up to four Hook()'s may be active at one time.  If there is no available
   Hook(), a warning is given, but processing continues. Since most Hook()'s
   are just used for screen settings, I don't feel BROWSE mode should be
   aborted upon a Hook() error.

   Cursor position is maintained at the upper left corner of the window to
   best maintain functional compatibility with LIST -and- to have some easy
   way of knowing where it will be when a command is issued.

   Most of this is my own work, other than the bContinuousScrolling() proc,
   which is based on AutoScroll by George De Bruin, Richard Blackburn, and
   Steve Watkins.

   However, I would not have been able to complete this without help from
   the friendly SemWare staff, Beta testers, and all of the generous TSE
   users who have shared their SAL code publicly.
