Description:	TSE Continuous WrapPara Macros and Key Definitions

Enclosed are a set of macros for "continuous" WrapPara in TSE.  These
macros were motivated by the likes of more fully functional word
processing programs like WordPerfect.

Once toggled "on" (using macro "ToggleContWrap()"), every cursor
movement (Up, Down, Left, Right, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, etc.) invokes
the "WrapPara()" function for the current and all "moved-through"
paragraph(s).  This gives the appearance of an "active" word-processor
like WordPerfect, in that the text is "constantly" reformatted to stay
within the defined margins.  "Cut", "Paste" and "Copy" operations are
also supported, and cause insertion or deletion followed by re-wrap.

Useful in E-mail and other environments that support an external editor
to guarantee that margin restrictions are not exceeded, WITHOUT
requiring users to press an additional key sequence.

CAUTIONS:

1.  The paragraph movement functions ASSUME that the definition of a
    paragraph is text separated by a BLANK LINE.  I may enhance this in
    the future, but for now it's locked into the code.  See also item 3
    below.  Note also that the Semware-supplied macro "mWrapPara()"
    makes this same assumption.

2.  When toggled "on", ALL text is re-wrapped.  This can have bizarre
    effects on E-mail header lines when you go to the top of the file.
    You will probably want to modify the "mBegFile()" code to prevent
    this.  Since each E-mail system is different, I have NOT included
    the changes I made for my local mail system.  Feel free to "fix" it
    for yours.

    The place to change is in macro "MarkWrapUp()".  Change the line:

        when zBegFile   BegFile()

    to do something like:

	when zBegFile	BegFile() Down() Down() Down() Down()

    to bypass however many header lines your E-mail system uses.

3.  "Lists" of things that are NOT in paragraph form will also be
    re-wrapped in bizarre ways.  This is strictly a function of the way
    the builtin-function "WrapPara()" works.  The only way to avoid it
    is to toggle "continuous" WrapPara OFF when moving through such
    text, or to separate each item in the list with a blank line (this
    being the definition of a paragraph).  See also item 1 above.

			support in archive TSEMAC.ZIP) AND two NEW
			macros, "BeginPara()" and "EndPara()" to move to
			the beginning and end of the current paragraph

Installation:

1.  Unzip the contents of this archive into your TSE\UI directory.

2.  Include the following line in TSE.S (or any modified copy thereof):

    #include ["contwrap.s"]

    FOLLOWING the definition of the macro "mWrapPara()".  ONLY the
    multi-line movement macros (PgUp, PgDn, etc) depend on
    "mWrapPara()".  You can also forward-reference "mWrapPara()" if you
    prefer that technique.

3.  REPLACE the following line in macro "mWrapPara()":

            until (not WrapPara()) or (not isCursorInBlock())

    with the following line:

	    until (CurrLine() >= Query(BlockEndLine) or not WrapPara())

    This bug causes the paragraph FOLLOWING a marked block to be
    "wrapped" even though it is NOT in the block.

4.  In the file TSE.KEY (or any modified copy thereof), assign an
    available key (I use <Alt w>) to macro "ToggleContWrap()":

    <Alt w>	    ToggleContWrap()

5.  Re-"Burn" your copy of TSE usinc "sc -b".
