(06-13-2004) - PromColr.s - Tse Pro v4.0+
This macro's default action is to color TSE
prompts consistently with other TSE color
settings, and to solve the viewing problem
if some prompt colors are the same.
Alternatively it lets you set prompt colors
yourself. For the latter it needs
SlctColr.zip to be pre-installed.
