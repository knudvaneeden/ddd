give one-key bookmark placement and selection
of bookmarks from a visual buffer. The buffer
is dynamically generated when needed, showing
bookmark letter, filename, line# and first 56
chars from the mark line. New:  Deletion of a
selected bookmark, small optimizations, and a
suggested set of menu calls.
