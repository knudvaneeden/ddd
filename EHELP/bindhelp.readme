bindhelp.si is part of TSE's Help system.

It cannot not be compiled by itself.

bindhelp.si is included for Semware's use, because it needed a tiny improvement
to make TSE's Help's history work properly with external help systems.

Without bindhelp.si being applied by Semware, eHelp will work, except for the
<Alt B> key, which will not (properly) work for external help systems.

The included bindhelp.si and eHelp.s work with each other.

Given that the included eHelp is in an unfinished state, the same might apply
to the included bindhelp.si.
