<16-Jun-2002>           TSE Pro/32 v2.8/3.x/4.x
--- Replaces OnlyOne.zip dated 22-May-2002 ---
"OnlyOne" allows only one copy of TSE to run
on a windows 9x/NT/2000 platform.  When you
edit a file from outside of the editor, the
single instance of TSE gets notified.  It then
opens the file, and brings itself to the
foreground.

Updated to solve focus issues under Win98
and Windows 2000

It can also now work with programs that expect
the editor to terminate only when you are finished
editing a file.  (When you quit the file, TSE
stays open, but control returns to the calling
application.)

Updated to work properly with the Becky Mail Client
(allowing you to use TSE as Becky's message editor)

It also has the ability to autosave all files
when it looses focus. See included Read.me file.
