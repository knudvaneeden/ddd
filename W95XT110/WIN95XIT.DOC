1. Overview
-----------

Win95Xit shuts down TSE, if it is running in a windowed session under
Win95 after the user has chosen the Close command or pressed the Close
button. Moreover, it displays the current filename as the title of the
window. This DOC also includes some hints how you can start TSE from the
Windows Explorer loading marked files.


2. What's New?
--------------

It's embarrassing to be forced to make an update just a couple of days
after the upload of the original macro. What happened? Well, I ran afoul
of an inconsistency of Microsoft's programmers' interface. Still, you can
blame me for not carefully enough reading the programmers' manual.

It's a bit tricky to explain the issue, but I'll try anyway. A DOS box in
Win95 has two titles. The virtual machine title and the application title.
Both are displayed at the title bar of the window separated by a dash.
When you're at the DOS prompt only the virtual machine title is displayed.
It's what you (or the operating system) entered at the title entry of the
program page within the corresponding pif file. When you execute a program
within a DOS box the name of the program is added as an application title
(you see this happen, if you run TSE from the prompt without loading
Win95Xit).

Well, if the virtual machine title is changed, as the first version of
Win95Xit did it, a couple of things will go wrong.  First of all, what the
programmers' manual doesn't state and what I didn't expect to happen, is
that Win95 saves changes to the virtual machine title within the pif file
(don't ask me why they do this). Perhaps, that's the reason why the
programmers' manual states that you should not change the virtual machine
title of a DOS box (I'm still wondering, why Microsoft included those API
calls anyway). And what's even more of a mystery, it also states that you
cannot rely on the operating system to have changed the windows titles of
a DOS box even when the API function signals success.

Well, after two hours of fruitless experiments I decided to remove the
parts of the macro which set the machine title. Moreover, I also included
another hook which forces the execution of the WhenPurged routine when TSE
is exited. (I don't think that this is necessary, but one never knows.)

If you should have used version 1.0 of this macro, please check the pif
settings of your DOS box shortcuts. The title entry on the program page of
these might by now all read "TSE" instead of what you or the operating
system put in there. This change is completely harmless, it only effects
what is displayed within the title bar of the DOS box. The best way to
reset these entries is to use the Windows find command and search for
"*.pif". Right click the relevant entries after the search has finished
and choose properties from the shortcut menu.

Well, after all, the answer to the question in the heading of this section
simply is: nothing. All I did, was to remove some pieces of code which did
not work properly.


3. Installation
---------------

First of all compile Win95Xit. Then copy the macro file to a place where
TSE can find it (the directory aka folder c:\tse\mac is the default).
Finally, you must add Win95Xit to the TSE autoload list. To accomplish
this, start TSE and choose "Autoload List" from the "Macro" menu. Press
<Ins> and type "win95xit" at the prompt. Press <Enter> twice and exit
TSE.


4. Using Win95Xit
-----------------

The source code of Win95Xit may look complicated and cryptic, but using
the macro actually is quite easy, because most of the time it is silently
working in the background. Only when you switch files or load a new file
you will notice that the title of your window changes to reflect the new
filename.

Moreover, as long as Win95Xit is loaded you can use the mechanisms built
into Win95 to exit TSE: either chose the Close command from the system
menu or press the Close button at the upper right corner of your window.
Don't be afraid, Win95Xit doesn't simply shut down the editor when you do
that. It calls SemWare's QuickXit macro instead and thus gives you the
opportunity to save your work or cancel the shutdown entirely.

Unfortunately there is a major drawback to that feature. It doesn't work
when you have executed TSE from within a DOS shell. You must launch TSE as
a stand alone application, if you want it to become close sensitive (as
the people at MS put it). The next section explains how you can do that.

Finally, you also cannot exit as long as TSE's menu or any macro is
active. When you close TSE with an active menu, Windows will add the
message "Closing" to your window's title, but nothing else will happen.
Simply press <Escape> until the menu is closed. This will also shut down
the Editor.


5. Launching TSE from the SendTo Menu
-------------------------------------

While working with the Windows Explorer you certainly have noticed the
entry christened "SendTo" which resides within the files context menu.
On default this allows you to send e-mail and print files or copy them
to a disk drive. The fine thing about this submenu is that it is fully
customizable. And what's even better, it's fairly easy to do so.

Well, let's pull up our sleeves and add TSE as a SendTo target. Open the
Windows Explorer and double click the Windows folder, so that you can
see its subdirectories (oops, the subfolders it contains :-)). One of
these should read SendTo. Click it. The files panel now displays a
couple of links (you cannot see the .lnk and .pif extensions, because
the Explorer will not display them whatever you may do). Well, you have
just uncovered the secret of the SendTo menu. Every link to a program
that you put into the SendTo folder will immediately appear within the
SendTo menu. There is an obvious limitation, though. The programs which
these links are referring to must understand filenames as command line
arguments, since the Explorer simply launches those programs with the
marked files added as a command line.

Ready? Ok! Search the TSE executable (e.exe within c:\tse on default).
It should be visible within the files panel. Next scroll the folders
outline, so that you again can see the SendTo folder. Grab TSE with the
mouse (left click it) and drag it onto the SendTo folder. This will
create a new entry (link) within the SendTo folder. Finally, give the
new entry a more pleasant name (e.g. TSE or Editor). You can also change
a couple of other things you might not like (e.g. the icon, the font and
the default startup directory). Right click your new link and choose
properties. This will pop up the pif editor (yes that's what it is)
which allows you to change these settings.

To test your new user interface, search some text file and right click it.
Choose SendTo and your new TSE entry and TSE will pop up with the file
already loaded. And what's the best, Win95Xit will now be fully
functional, that is you can exit your TSE session by clicking the Windows
Close button.


6. Bugs & Co.
-------------

Well, this program is fairly short. This is to say, that I'm also fairly
sure that it doesn't include too many bugs. Well, it seems that I was a bit
overoptimistic :-( with the first version. I hope that the macro is sound
this time. As always, if you should find something buggy, have a suggestions
on what is missing or just wanted to say hello, please contact me. My name
still is Dieter K”ssl :-) and my e-mail address is
