(02-03-03) Two fonts (SysMono 14x6 and 18x8)
by Andrew Clarke (based on some OS/2 fonts)
are available from the sysmono-nt.zip link in
the list that follows. They will work with
TSE Pro v4.0 for Windows (any WIN9x-WINXP),
and are also available to TSE Pro/32 under
Windows NT/2000/XP.

Fonts.zip contains 8 fonts for use
with TSE Pro v4.0 for Windows. Contributed by
Michael Durland (sprog*.fon), Chris Antos
(fixedsysoem14.fon), and Karl Bochert
(Kourier and Ksans).

Kourier: a mono-spaced font patterned after
         Courier, but with larger punctuation
         and distinct l & 1, o & 0
Ksans: a san-serif version of Kourier for a
       cleaner, more modern look.

A list of additional fonts that have been
mentioned by customers as working with
TSEPro v4.0 for Windows:
