INTRODUCTION
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

Welcome to the Quiet Flight macros written specifically for
The Semware Editor Professional (TSE Pro) v2.5 and the productive
programmer.

These macros are TSE Pro extensions for FoxPro, dBase, & Clipper
programmers. They're much more than that because they work well with C,
ASM, Pascal and, of course, TSE Pro files.

The Quiet Flight macros were created by a couple of programmers who
do software development in dBASE every day.  The macros range from
extremely simple ("Show Changed") to full-fledged programs ("Flow").
As a whole, they provide a very powerful and efficient development
environment.

Excerpt from the original Quiet Flight for BRIEF documentation:

     "By the way, the name 'Quiet Flight' might seem strange for some
     BRIEF macros that speed up dBase programming.  Aren't you dtired
     of dThis and dThat dnames for dBase oriented products?  We are,
     so we got bold and reached back into the past and came up with a
     name that would best suit our fancy.  We chose "Quiet Flight"
     because it reminds us of the days when we still had the time for
     fun things like an afternoon of surfing or frisbee.  Maybe one
     day these macros will make us productive enough for those good
     old "spare" hours of fun and leisure.

                            Peace & Joy to you!"

We still hope this is true with the TSE Pro macros we have provided for
your use.

INSTALLATION
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

Copy the QF macro files into your TSE Pro macros sub-directory.  Don't
worry, all of our macros start with the letters QF, so you'll be able to
quickly uninstall them with a DEL QF*.*.


It's *IMPORTANT* also to set an environment variable QFPATH to the
location of the macros.  We suggest you do this in your autoexec.bat
file.

For example, add this line to your autoexec.bat file:

   SET QFPATH=[Directory name]

In place of [Directory name], place the directory where you have
stored the QF files.  If you've set up QF files in the C:\TSE
sub-directory, then the line would look like this:

   SET QFPATH=C:\TSE

This change will not take effect until you restart your system or
manually type in the QFPATH statement at the DOS prompt.

Also, please make sure to copy QFX.EXE to a sub-directory in
your path. Or if you prefer, add the QF sub-directory to
your path.   This file is used by Quiet Flight to assist you
with displaying your index keys.


To have the QF macros to start up automatically, you have 3 choices:

   - CHOICE 1:

     Modify (or create a new) TSESTART.S file to load Quiet
     Flight.  TSESTART is executed before any other macros
     when TSE Pro is loaded.  Here is what our TSESTART.S
     file looks like:

        proc main()
           execmacro("c:\tse\qf\qf.mac")
           return()
        end main

     Don't forget to compile the file using SC:

        SC tsestart.s


   - CHOICE 2:

     Edit TSE.UI (or your own TSE Pro configuration file), search for
     "proc WhenLoaded()" and add the line ExecMacro("QF") just before
     the end of the procedure.  For instance:

        proc WhenLoaded()
           integer cid = GetBufferId()
           pick_buffer = CreateTempBuffer()
           GotoBufferId(cid)
           ExecMacro("qf")                 <-- Add this line
        end

   - CHOICE 3:

     Load QF from your command line using TSE Pro's "-e" command-line
     option.  For example:

        E.EXE test.prg -eQF

     You can put this inside a batch file to have TSE Pro always load
     the Quiet Flight macros.

        Example contents of a QF.BAT:
        @echo off
        echo.
        echo Loading TSE Pro with Quiet Flight
        echo.
        E.EXE %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 -eQF

        Using this file you could start the editor like this:
        QF test.prg

Quiet Flight does not load properly when added to TSE Pro's AutoLoad
list.

To load QF from inside the editor:

   Access the Macro/Execute menu or press the key assigned to ExecMacro(),
   default is <Ctrl X>.  Then enter "QF" for the macro to execute.

CONFIGURING QUIET FLIGHT
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

We have tried to make Quiet Flight as extensible and flexible as
possible.  This allows for support of a multitude of programming
languages and--most importantly--allows Quiet Flight to work to your
tastes and preferences.


ş QF.CFG

The primary means of configuring Quiet Flight is through the QF.CFG
file.  This file should be located in the same directory as your
Quiet Flight macros.

QF.CFG is composed of several sections which delineate related
settings.  If you are familiar with how the Microsoft Windows .INI
files are grouped, you will have no trouble grasping the format of
QF.CFG.  The following format is used in both environments:

[Section Name]
KeyName=value

The brackets ([]) are part of the section name, so must be included.
A section name may be followed by an equals sign (=) and a list of
extensions separated by spaces.  That means the following settings
apply only to files of the named extensions.  For example, the
following [GENERAL] section applies only to .C and .CPP extensions:

[GENERAL=.C .CPP]


A KeyName is a alphanumeric string (upper or lower case), immediately
followed by an equals sign (=) and the value setting.  The following
example turns the QF Restore feature off for all undefined extensions,
and sets the default comment string to be "**".

[GENERAL]
Restore=OFF
CommentStart=**

Configuration settings which require on/off values should be set to
values of "ON" or "OFF" (as in the example above).  Settings which
require strings or numbers should be entered as-is with NO quotation
marks.

Lines which begin with a semicolon (;) are treated as comments.
Comment lines are ignored by Quiet Flight.

    ³  All of the Quiet Flight settings are documented within the    ³
    ³  QF.CFG file.  Review QF.CFG and the default settings to       ³
    ³  configure QF to your preferences.                             ³

ş Multiple Configurations

You may be in an environment where you need to use more than one
QF.CFG file.  A perfect example is if two people are sharing one
machine, or TSE Pro is being run off a network and the Quiet Flight
files are stored in a common directory.

You may specify an alternate configuration file by setting the
DOS environment variable QFCFG.  Quiet Flight will append the
value of the variable QFCFG to "QF" to arrive at the configuration
filename.  For example, if I set QFCFG=JEN, then Quiet Flight will
look for a configuration file named QFJEN.CFG.

If "Mark" logs in and sets QFCFG=MARK, then Quiet Flight looks
to the file QFMARK.CFG for its configuration information.



KEY ASSIGNMENTS
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

SHAREWARE USERS:  Key assignments may not be changed in the shareware
version of Quiet Flight.  Register Quiet Flight to receive full source
code to the product, enabling the redefinition of key assignments.

Key assignments for the Quiet Flight macros are embedded in the source
code.  To modify the default settings you should edit QFKEY.INC and
search for "KeyDef QFKeys".  Edit the assignments as necessary and save
the QFKEY.INC.  You must recompile QF.S and reload Quiet Flight for the
changes to take effect.

You may also want to edit QFMENU.INC to reflect your changes on the
Quiet Flight menu.

In defining the default key assignment for QF, we made every effort to
choose keys which would not interfere with your current operation of TSE
Pro The following keys are the default assignments for the Quiet Flight
macros:

   <Alt />         Quiet Flight Menu
   <Alt 1>         Comment/Uncomment Block
   <Alt 2>         Screen Counter
   <Alt 3>         Flow

ALL-PURPOSE MACROS
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

ş Unload/Reload QF      <Alt \>

At times you may wish to disable the Quiet Flight macros, thus
recovering the key assignments used by QF.  You can do this quite
easily by pressing <Alt \>.  Press <Alt \> again to return to normal
Quiet Flight operation.


ş Quiet Flight Menu     <Alt />

If you forget the key assignment for a Quiet Flight function, press
<Alt /> to pop up a menu of commands.  Every major QF function is
listed, along with its corresponding key assignment.


ş Edit QF.CFG           <Alt F11>

This is simply a hotkey for loading the QF.CFG file.  It locates
and loads QF.CFG, making it the current buffer.


ş Re-load QF.CFG         <Alt F12>

After you have made changes to QF.CFG, you most likely will want
them to take effect without having to exit TSE Pro.  Executing this
function will force Quiet Flight to reload the changes you have
made to the configuration file.


ş Directory Lister      <Alt 9>

Quiet Flight's Directory Lister (QFDir) makes it easy to navigate
directories and maintain files.  Some of the features of the QFDir
are:

   - Directory names placed at top of directory list
   - Speedkey searching
   - Tag multiples files to load into TSE Pro
   - Delete single/tagged files
   - View modes for text files, dBASE database & index structures,
     binary files, and .ZIP files
   - Sort directories by name, size, extension, or date
   - Set home directory

The first thing QFDir requests for upon executing is a file specification.
The default is all files (*.*) in the same directory as the current file
in TSE Pro's buffer.

After entering a file specification, a list of all sub-directories
and matching files are displayed in a new window.  Sub-directories are
always grouped at the top.  Use the arrow keys, <Home>, <End>,
<PgUp>, and <PgDn> to scroll through the directory list.  Hotkeys
are defined for all actions in QFDir:

   - <F1> = Help
     This presents a menu of available actions.  Press <Enter> on a
     menu item to execute the function, or <Esc> to exit the menu.

   - <Ctrl S> = Sort Order
     You can change the sort order with this function.  QFDir
     can sort files by name, date, extension, or size.

   - <Spacebar> = Toggle Tag
     QFDir allows you to tag files for editing or deleting.  Press
     <Spacebar> to toggle a tag on a file.  Keep in mind that tags
     only exist for the current directory--you may not have tags
     spanning across different directories.

   - <Ctrl T> = Tag All
     Use this function to tag all files in the current directory.

   - <Ctrl U> = Untag All
     Remove all tags by pressing <Ctrl U>.

   - <Ctrl R> = Reverse Tags
     Reversing tags will untag all tagged files, and tag the
     files which were previously untagged.

   - <Enter> = Load hilited/tagged
     If the hilite bar is positioned on a directory entry, <Enter>
     will automatically change directories, updating the display
     to show the files in the new directory.  All tags will be
     lost.

     If there are no tags defined and the hilite bar is resting on
     a filename, then that file is loaded into TSE Pro's buffer ring.
     However, if there are tags defined, QFDir will prompt whether
     to load the current file or the tagged files.

     QFDir quits after loading files, returning to TSE Pro's editing
     screen.

   - <Del> = Delete Current File
     Press <Del> to delete the currently hilited file.  For safety,
     you are prompted before QFDir performs the deletion.

   - <Ctrl D> = Delete Tagged Files
     To delete all tagged files, press <Ctrl D>.  You are first
     asked whether or not to confirm each deletion.  If you answer
     "Yes," then QFDir will prompt you before deleting each file.
     Otherwise, QFDir performs the deletions in batch without
     confirmation.

   - <Ctrl V> = View File
     You can view the currently hilited file without loading it by
     pressing <Ctrl V>.  QFDir recognizes dBASE database/index
     structures and .ZIP files, displaying them in the appropriate
     format.  Some binary extensions, such as .EXE and .COM, are
     also recognized as such and displayed in TSE Pro's binary mode.

     ***VERY IMPORTANT***
     In order for the specialized viewers to work, these
     files must be available in the DOS path:  QFX.EXE and
     PKWARE's PKZIP.

   - <Ctrl B> = Binary View
     You can force a binary view (rather than an Ascii view) with
     this function.

   - <Ctrl L> = Log New Directory
     Quickly change directories or file specifications by pressing
     <Ctrl L>.  For example, if you are currently listing all
     files (*.*) but wish to see only your C++ files, change the
     file specification to: *.CPP.

    ³ The only way to log into a new drive with QFDir is through     ³
    ³ the Log New Directory command.  Press <Ctrl L> and enter       ³
    ³ the new drive letter and directory. ie A:\                     ³
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

   - <Ctrl H> = Set Home Directory
     You can make the directory being viewed the TSE Pro default
     directory with the Set Home Directory function.  Setting the home
     directory means that TSE Pro will default to that directory when
     shelling to DOS, creating new files, etc.

   - <Esc> = Exit QFDir
     If you wish to exit QFDir without loading any files, press <Esc>.

Speedkey is enabled in QFDir.  So, if you start typing a filename,
it jumps to the closest match.  Precede your entry with a backslash (\)
to jump to directory names.


ş Zip View              <Alt 8>

Quiet Flight Zip View (QFZip) allows you to maintain existing .ZIP
files from within TSE Pro.

***VERY IMPORTANT***
In order for QFZip to work, PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP must be
available in the DOS path.


The first thing QFZip requests for upon executing is a file
specification. The default is all .ZIP files (*.ZIP) in the same
directory as the current file in TSE Pro's buffer.

After entering a file specification, a list of all sub-directories and
matching files are displayed in a new window.  Sub-directories are
always grouped at the top.  Use the arrow keys, <Home>, <End>,
<PgUp>, and <PgDn> to scroll through the directory list.  Press <Enter>
to select a ZIP file to view, or <Esc> to return to TSE Pro.

The Zip View Window displays a list of the files contained in the
selected ZIP file.  You may perform any of these functions on
the current ZIP archive:

   - <F1> = Help
     This present a menu of available actions.  Press <Enter> on a
     menu item to execute the function, or <Esc> to exit the menu.

   - <Ctrl S> = Sort Order
     You can change the sort order with this function.  QFZip
     can sort entries by name, date, extension, or size.

   - <Spacebar> = Toggle Tag
     QFZip allows you to tag entries.  Press <Spacebar> to toggle a
     tag on a ZIP entry.

   - <Ctrl T> = Tag All
     Use this function to tag all entries contained in the ZIP file.

   - <Ctrl U> = Untag All
     Remove all tags by pressing <Ctrl U>.

   - <Ctrl R> = Reverse Tags
     Reversing tags will untag all tagged entries, and tag the
     entries which were previously untagged.

   - <Enter> = Extract Current File
     Extract a single entry of the ZIP file by hiliting the entry
     and pressing <Enter>.  You will be prompted before the extraction
     is performed.

   - <Ctrl E> = Extract Tagged
     You may extract multiple files from a ZIP archive by tagging
     the selected entries and pressing <Ctrl E>.

   - <Ctrl A> = Extract All
     Extract all files (tagged or untagged) from a ZIP archive with
     this function.

   - <Ins> = Insert File(s)
     Files may be inserted into a ZIP archive by pressing <Ins>.
     A new directory window is displayed in which you may tag the files
     to insert.  Press <Enter> when done.

   - <Del> = Delete File
     Delete the hilited ZIP entry by pressing <Del>.

   - <Ctrl D> = Delete Tagged
     Remove all tagged entries from the ZIP archive with the <Ctrl D>
     key.

   - <Ctrl F> = Freshen Zip
     Freshen the entries in the ZIP with this function.  This updates
     the ZIP with any newer versions of the member files.

   - <Ctrl V> = View File
     You may view a ZIP entry, without extracting it, by pressing
     <Ctrl V> on the hilited file.  Keep in mind that there must
     be enough free disk space to hold a temporary version of the
     file being viewed.

   - <Ctrl P> = Set Password
     If an entry in a ZIP has a password attached, you can still
     access it with QFZip using the Set Password function.  If a
     password is set using <Ctrl P>, then any files inserted with
     QFZip will acquire that password as well.

   - <Ctrl O> = Toggle Overwrite
     By default, PKWARE's PKUNZIP will prompt you if try to overwrite
     an existing file when extracting.  You can have toggle this
     safety feature on and off with QFZip's <Ctrl O> key.

   - <Esc> = Exit QFZip View mode
     To close the ZIP View window and select another ZIP file to view,
     press <Esc>.


-Configuring Zip View-

If you have renamed PKZIP.EXE and/or PKUNZIP.EXE to alternate file
names, you may specify the new names in QF.CFG.  Under the heading
[ZIP] look for the keynames "ZipFile" and "UnZipFile" and set these
to the appropriate filenames.  For example, if PKZIP.EXE is called
ZIP.EXE and PKUNZIP.EXE is UNZIP.EXE on your system, the keynames
would be defined as follows:

ZipFile=ZIP
UnZipFile=UNZIP


ş Quick Commenter       <Alt 1>

The Quiet Flight commenter allows you to quickly comment/uncomment a
block of code.  To use, simply mark the lines you want to comment (using
either a line or character block) and press <Alt 1>.  The blocked lines
are commented out, and a header is inserted documenting the time and date.

There are two ways to uncomment code commented out by the QF commenter.
The easiest method is to position the cursor on the line of the comment
header and press <Alt 1>.  The entire block of commented code is
uncommented, and the header is removed.  The comment header looks
something like this for xBASE code:

    ** Commented out 11/30/92 at 03:26 pm

However, if you wish to uncomment just a portion of the commented code,
mark the lines you wish to uncomment and press <Alt 1>.  Quiet Flight will
only uncomment those lines which are included in the mark.


-Configuring Quick Commenter-

Quiet Flight provides built-in support for commenting these file types:

   C/C++         --> .C   .CPP .H
   xBASE code    --> .PRG .CH  .FRG .SPR .MPR .FMT
   SAL Macros    --> .S   .INC .UI
   Batch/System  --> .BAT .SYS .INI

If you wish to define comment characters for a new file extension, or
wish to change the default characters for a pre-defined extension, you
can do so through QF.CFG.  Beneath a [GENERAL=<extensions>] section
you may add "CommentStart" and "CommentEnd" keynames.

Suppose I wished to change the comment characters for C++ files from the
default // to the more traditional /*..*/.  Here is an abstract of my
[GENERAL] section for .CPP files:

[GENERAL=.CPP]
CommentStart=/*
CommentEnd=*/


ş Where Am I?           <Num 5>

To find out what procedure or function you are currently positioned in,
use the Where Am I function of Quiet Flight.  The procedure/function is
displayed on the TSE Pro message line.

If you keep the default key assignment (<Num 5>), keep in mind that
NumLock must be turned off for this to work.


ş Project Manager       <Alt 0>

The Quiet Flight Project Manager allows you to group related files
in order to load them together.  For example, you could create a
project called SYSTEM.PRJ which automatically loads AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS.

The Project Manager presents a menu with three options.  Each of these
is discussed below:

   - Open Project:  Select this option to open an existing project or
     create a new Project.

     If the project exists, all files associated with that project
     are loaded into TSE Pro's buffer ring.  If an associated file is
     not found, you are asked if that file should be removed from
     the project.

     If the project does not exist, QF assumes it is a new project.
     You can add files to the project through Quiet Flight's Buffer
     List (detailed in the next section).

     If a project is already open when you open or create a project,
     the previous project is automatically closed.

   - Close Project:  To close a project--but leave the associated
     files open in the TSE Pro ring--select this option.

   - Close Project w/Files:  A project and all associated files may
     be closed using this option.

    ÚÄÄ QF TIP! ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
    ³ You can load projects from any TSE Pro Edit File prompt by     ³
    ³ specifying the project name with the .PRJ extension.  This     ³
    ³ includes loading projects from the command line.  For example, ³
    ³ if you wanted to run TSE Pro and load the SYSTEM project at the³
    ³ same time, you would enter this DOS command: E SYSTEM.PRJ      ³
    ³ Or, at the TSE Pro "File(s) to edit:" prompt, enter SYSTEM.PRJ ³
    ³ to automatically load the project files.                       ³
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


-Configuring Project Manager-

The default directory for storing project files may be set in the QF.CFG
file.  Look under the [GENERAL] section in QF.CFG for a keyname titled
"ProjectDir".  If you do not want project files stored in the current
directory, then you must set this keyname to the directory in which
to store the .PRJ files.  For example, you might set it to store project
files in C:\TSE\PROJECT\:

ProjectDir=C:\TSE\PROJECT\

It is highly recommended that you set this option so that project files
are not strewn about your hard disk and unlocatable by the Project
Manager.


ş Buffer List           <Alt B>

Although there is a buffer list included with TSE Pro, Quiet Flight
provides enhancements with its own buffer list.

Like TSE, Quiet Flight lists all files in the edit ring and displays a
"*" next to files which have been modified but not saved.  In addition,
the following keys are defined:

   - <F1> = Help
     Press F1 for help when using QF's Buffer List.

   - <Enter> = Edit
     To make a file the current edit buffer, hilite it and press <Enter>.

   - <Ctrl C>, <F10> = Close File & Remove from Ring
     Delete the current file from the TSE Pro buffer ring by pressing
     either <Ctrl C>, <F10>.  If the file has been modified, you are
     asked whether to save the changes or not before closing.

   - <Ctrl W>, <Ctrl Enter> = Write Changes
     Save the changes to a buffer by pressing <Ctrl W> or <Ctrl Enter>
     on the selected file.  Notice that the "*" is immediately removed,
     indicating that the file no longer needs to be saved.

If a QF Project is open, the QF Buffer List displays a separate list
of project files below the normal buffer list.  All project files are
displayed, even if they are not currently in the TSE Pro buffer ring.
Project files not in the ring are listed in parenthesis.

In the following example, CONFIG.SYS is in the TSE Pro ring but AUTOEXEC.BAT
is not, although both are part of the SYSTEM project.  WIN.INI is also
loaded in the TSE Pro ring (and has been modified) but is *NOT* part of the
project:

   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ QF Buffer List ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
   ³* WIN.INI        c:\windows\                               ³
   ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Project SYSTEM ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´
   ³ (AUTOEXEC.BAT)  c:\                                       ³
   ³  CONFIG.SYS     c:\                                       ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄ ENTER: Edit  F10: Close  ESC: Cancel  F1: Help ÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


In addition to the keys listed above, the following keys are defined if
a QF Project is open:

   - <Ins> = Insert into Project
     Additions may be made to a project with this function.  When a
     non-project file is hilited, press <Ins> to immediately add it to
     the project list.  From then on, the selected file will be loaded
     as part of the project.

   - <Del> = Delete from Project
     To remove a file from the current project, hilite the project file
     to remove and press <Del>.  The file is then moved to the upper
     window of the QF Buffer List window and out of the project list.

   - <TAB> = Switch Windows
     Quickly switch between the upper and lower halves of the Buffer
     List window with the <TAB> key.


ş New Header            <Ctrl N>

We know you know what program headers are.  That's why you have
the capability of adding your own header to any file you edit. Just
press Ctrl N.  Here's one installed in a PRG file.

* Program....: qf.prg
* Version....: 1.01
* Author.....: Randy Wallin
* Date.......: August 4, 1993     Last Modified: 08/04/93 @ 11:40 pm
* Notice.....: Copyright (c) 1993 COB System Designs, Inc., All Rights Reserved.
* QFRestore..: ¯0,0®
* Compiler...: FoxPro 2.5
* Abstract...: qf.prg
* Changes....:

We also know that you have a particular style of header that you like to
use.  If you'll take a minute to look through the QF.CFG file, you'll
find our example headers under HEADER.  You can modify them to your own
specifications.

Here's the QF.CFG fragment that's responsible for creating our PRG
headers:

HEADER={
* Program....: ##FILE##
* Version....: ##VERSION##
* Author.....: ##NAME##
* Date.......: ##FILEDATE##     Last Modified: ##DATE## @ ##TIME##
* Notice.....: Copyright (c) ##YEAR## ##COMPANY##, All Rights Reserved.
* QFRestore..: ¯0,0®
* Compiler...: ##PRG_COMPILER##
* Abstract...: ##FILE## ~
* Changes....:
}

Each of the keywords is surrounded by double pound signs (##).
This is a list of the keywords used in this header:

  ##FILE##       = File Name + File Ext
  ##VERSION##    = Version #
  ##NAME##       = Author's Name
  ##FILEDATE##   = IF this is an existing file - use the last date saved
                   ELSE use DATESTR
  ##DATE##       = Today's Date - 11/09/92
  ##TIME##       = Current Time
  ##DATESTR##    = Today's Date String - November 11, 1992
  ##YEAR##       = Year (for Copyright usually)
  ##COMPANY##    = Company name in Copyright.

ş Edit New File         <Ctrl E>

Being a developer means that we work in many different directories
during the day.  The standard Edit File prompt in TSE Pro always assumes
you want to edit a file in the startup directory.  The QF Edit New File
will assume the directory of the currently edited code as well as the
current extension.

-How we use QF's Edit New File-

I start up TSE Pro in the C:\TSE sub-directory and edit files in several
of my projects directories (c:\jli\admin, c:\dmi\service,
c:\marlins\scout, etc.).  When I am editing SCOUT.PRG in MARLINS\SCOUT -
when I press CTRL-E and type in TEAM - QF assumes I am looking for
C:\MARLINS\SCOUT\ TEAM.PRG.  When I am editing c:\JLI\ADMIN\USER.DOC and
press CTRL-E and enter ADMIN - QF assumes I am attempting to edit
C:\JLI\ADMIN\ADMIN.DOC.

ş Kill Restore File     <Ctrl K>

There are many times when you start editing a file and realize that
you need to go back to the original file (before modifications).
Normally you have to quit the file (saying NO to save changes) and
then re-load the original.  With Quiet Flight's Kill Restore macro,
you just press the hotkey for Kill Restore (default <Ctrl K>).  After
confirmation, the changes on the current file are killed, and the file
is restored to its original state.


-How We Use Kill Restore-

We run Microsoft Windows on all of our development machines, thus
allowing us to load FoxPro in one session and TSE Pro in another.
Sometimes we end up making a change to a .PRG within FoxPro while the
file is still loaded in TSE Pro.  To update the file in TSE Pro with
the changes made in FoxPro, we simply run Kill Restore.


ş Save All Modified     <Ctrl S>

Quiet Flight assigns to a single key the process of saving all files
without exiting TSE Pro.  Press <Ctrl S> and all *modified* files in
the edit ring are saved.  The number of saved files is displayed on the
TSE Pro message line.

ş Display File Info     <Alt F>

Display File Info shows on the message line relevant information about
the current file being edited.  This includes:  full path, modification
status, original file size (as stored on disk), file date and time.


ş Show Changed          <Ctrl 2>

Show Changed is a simple aide for documenting changes to your source
code.  Pressing <Ctrl 2> inserts a comment at the cursor line which
details the date a change was made.

   ** Changed on 11/30/92

By assigning this little comment to a single keystroke, you may be more
likely to document the changes to your code.


ş Window Size           (via QF menu)

How many times have you had a block of text and needed to insert it in
a Window?  After marking the area you want measured (we suggest a
Column Block), invoke the Window Size macro (default <Alt S>).  The
message line will then display the Window Size.

For example, let's find the coordinates necessary to enclose
the following block of text (taken from TSE Pro's manual) in a window:

   x
     PARAMETER_TYPE is the type (INTEGER or STRING) of the identifier
     which follows. If VAR prefixes the type, the parameter must be a
     variable (as opposed to an expression or constant), which may
     possibly be altered by the command.
                                                                      x

Place the cursor on the (x) above the word PARAMETER_TYPE, then begin
your column mark.  End your column mark where the lower right hand
corner of the Window will be (the x to the right of the last
sentence).

Press <Alt S> and note the message bar looks similar to the following:

   Current Block:  Rows, Cols 6,68 *OR* FROM 2,3 TO 7,70

The Rows, Columns are Physical Size of the block (6 x 68).  The
information to the right of *OR* are the window coordinates (the
window coordinates will vary depending on the position of the block
relative the the top/left of the TSE Pro window).  You would use these
coordinates for your window definition.  For example:

   DEFINE WINDOW <WinName> FROM 2,3 TO 7,70


ş Screen Counter        <Alt 2>

The screen counter establishes the correct position of an unknown
position relative to a known one.  For example, the code says:

   @ 12,30 SAY "Your Choice? " GET ans PICTURE [#]

Let's say you need another prompt--"Valid choices are 1-5"--to be
positioned just past the GET statement.

Place the cursor on the "Y" in "Your", invoke the screen counter
(default <Alt 2>), initialize the row as 12 and the column as 30. Move
your cursor key to position it where you want the coordinates and
press the ESC key.

In this case, the column number would be 46.

Now you can add:

@ 12,46 SAY "Valid choices are 1-5"

You may use all the directional keys to get to the exact location for
the coordinates.


ş Special Keys

   - To help keep you out of trouble with mismatched braces, quotes, and
     parenthesis, Quiet Flight enters them as a pair.  When you enter (,
     [, ", or { you will automatically get the closing ), ], ", or }.

   - <Spacebar> activates the QF Shorthand facility when the cursor is
     positioned immediately following the first word on a line.  To
     expand an abbreviation which is not the first word on a line, press
     <Alt Backspace>. QF always looks for an abbreviation immediately to
     the left of the cursor.


ş Shorthand Abbreviations

QF.CFG is Quiet Flight's configuration file.  It should be
located in your QFPATH sub-directory.

Within QF.CFG you will find a place for your abbreviations, a
very powerful extension for all your programming.

For instance, in an xBase program file, on a new line you type in
the following:

   dow <Spacebar>

You are then prompted for the expression.  You enter:

   nLine=ROW()

The "dow" line is replaced with

  DO WHILE nLine=ROW()
     _ <-- this is where your cursor will be waiting for further input
  ENDDO &&* nLine=ROW()

You can create your own abbreviations.  They can be inline
abbreviations ( ie ACW(space) -> ACTIVATE WINDOW ) or full code
blocks, like DOW above.

The configuration file is setup in the following format:

[HEADER DESCRIPTION]
Configuration Items
Use the semicolon (;) to delimit comments


For example:

[EXPANSION=.SPR .PRG .MPR .QPR .FMT .CH]
ALS=ALLTRIM(STR(~))
DEW=DEACTIVATE WINDOW ~
OKL=ON KEY LABEL ~
PAR=PARAMETERS ~
PKC=PUSH KEY CLEAR
POK=POP KEY
PRI=PRIVATE ~

FOR={
FOR ##FOR Expression eg i=1 to 50##
    ~
ENDFOR &&* ##FOR Expression eg i=1 to 50##
}


Now, let's decipher this:

[EXPANSION=.SPR .PRG .MPR .QPR .FMT .CH]

The first line determines what file extensions will use the
following abbreviations.  In this case, we want it to be any file
with the extension of SPR, PRG, MPR, QPR, etc.

The subsequent lines determine what you'd like to happen when
you enter the abbreviation and press <Spacebar>.

ALS=ALLTRIM(STR(~))
                    QF will insert ALLTRIM(STR()) then place the
                    cursor where the tilde (~) is placed.

POK=POP KEY
                    QF will insert POP KEY when you type in POK
                    and press <Spacebar>


Now for the good stuff, the multi-line expansions:

FOR={
FOR ##FOR Expression eg i=1 to 50##
    ~
ENDFOR &&* ##FOR Expression eg i=1 to 50##
}

When you type in FOR<Spacebar> on a new line, you will be prompted
with "For Expression eg i=1 to 50" -- that's everything between
the double pound signs (##).

Type in your FOR expression and press <Enter>.  The expansion macro
will do the rest.  Let's say you enter i=1 to nCharacters, this is
the result.
FOR i=1 TO nCharacters
    - cursor would be waiting here
ENDFOR &&* i=1 TO nCharacters

Follow these steps to create your own abbreviations:

   1. Locate the EXPANSION file extension you want to place your
      abbreviations.  Or create a new [EXPANSION=<extensions>] section
      for extensions that are not already defined.

   2. Decide whether it will be a single or multi-line abbreviation.

      a. Single-Line Abbreviation
         The characters to the left of the equals sign determines
         the abbreviation--immediately followed by an equals sign (=),
         then the expansion phrase.  The following:

              STS=STORE STR() TO

         will insert "STORE STR() TO".

         If you add the tilde (~) between the parenthesis (), the
         cursor will return there after the expansion:

              STS=STORE STR(~) TO

      b. Multi-line Abbreviation

         Again, we have the first characters to the left of the equals
         to determine the abbreviation--immediately followed by =, then
         the open curly brace {.

         Here's an example:

            DON={
            DO WHILE .NOT. EOF()
               ~
            ENDDO &&* .NOT. EOF()
            }

          When you type in DON and press <Spacebar>, the DON will be
          replaced by the code block within the curly braces ({}).

          Now, to add "user" (that's you in this case) input, just
          add an Input Prompt, preceded by a dollar sign ($) and
          terminated with a period (.).

          Another example:

             DOW={
             DO WHILE ##Expression##
                ~
             ENDDO &&* ##Expression##
             }

          The Input Prompt can be simple--like the one above--or more
          elaborate, like:  ##Your DO WHILE Expression, Sir##

There are several other special expressions you can add to
your keyboard expansion configuration file.

   1. If you place a variable within % (ie %VARIABLE%), Quiet
      Flight will grab that value from the DOS environment
      variable and insert it into your expansion.

      A simple example would be a multi-programmer shop, if each
      programmer sets their name up as a DOS environment variable
      (SET AUTHOR=STEVE), then %AUTHOR% would expand to STEVE.  On
      Patty's machine, AUTHOR would expand to PATTY.

   2. If you place your expansion variable in a $Variable^,
      QF will Hilite the variable, and delete it if a non-movement
      (cursor) key pressed.

      This is handy when you have a default answer but want the
      ability to change it on the fly.

         RVW=This code was reviewed by $Korie^

      When you expand RVW, Korie's name will be highlighted--if
      you press <Enter>, Korie's name remains.  Typing anything
      else will replace Korie's name with your input.

ş Add LOCAL/PRIVATE Declaration  <Alt F5/F6>

Adding LOCAL and PRIVATE declarations to your code has never
been easier.  You usually add these declarations to your code
when you use the variable.  This entails finding the top of
the procedure/function, adding the declaration, and then finding
your place again where the variable is used.  It is so cumbersome
that you might even be tempted to skip doing a declaration at all.

Quiet Flight solves the problem.  With your cursor positioned
anywhere on the variable to declare (or immediately following it),
press Alt-F5.  Quiet Flight automatically adds the variable to
your LOCAL list.  Pressing Alt-F6 adds it to your PRIVATE list.
If such a list doesn't already exist, then one is started.

For example, suppose your code looks like this, and your cursor
is positioned at the caret (^):

   PROCEDURE MsgBox
   PARAMETERS cMsg

   PRIVATE nReturnVal

   nReturnVal
             ^

After pressing Alt-F6, your code now contains the PRIVATE declaration:

   PROCEDURE MsgBox
   PARAMETERS cMsg
   PRIVATE nReturnVal

   PRIVATE nReturnVal

   nReturnVal
             ^

If the PRIVATE list already exists, the variable is appended to the
existing list.


ş Flow                  <Alt 3>

The Flow program will reindent and comment your source code to make
it more readable.  Features include:

   - Code indentation.  Reformat your .PRG files with proper
     indentation.  Handles FoxPro, dBase IV, and Clipper dialects.

   - Conditionals Commenting.  Puts same-line comments on all
     end-conditional statements.  For example, take the following
     code fragment:
                    DO WHILE !EOF()
                      .
                      .
                    ENDDO

     After processing by Flow it will look like this:

                    DO WHILE !EOF()
                      .
                      .
                    ENDDO && !EOF()    <-- notice the same-line comment

   - Error Checking.  Flow can verify that your code does not have
     mismatched conditional statements.  For example, you are notified if
     you have an ENDIF without a corresponding IF, or a DO without an
     ENDDO.

   - Full configuration.  You control the indentation level,
     whether to use tabs or spaces, the type of DO CASE and
     function indenting, and whether or not errors should be reported.


When invoked, Flow present a menu of actions and configuration
options. The first two options ("Procedure/Function" and "File") start
the Flow process. Select "Procedure/Function" to process the current
procedure or function the cursor is currently positioned in.  If you
are not positioned in a procedure/function, then Flow will start at
the beginning of the file and proceed until the start of a
procedure/function or end of file.

Select "File" to start processing an entire .PRG file.  Flow starts at
the beginning of the file and continues to the end, processing every
function and procedure along the way.

The rest of the options on the Flow menu are for configuration.  They
are detailed below:

   - Indentation:  Select this option to change the indentation level.
     For example, if you set it to 3, then three spaces will be
     inserted for each level of indentation.  If Hard Tabs (see below)
     is set to ON then this indentation level is ignored.

   - Function Indent:  If set to ON, code beneath a function/procedure
     is indented an additional one level.  If OFF, indentation starts
     at column 0.  The following procedure was "Flowed" with Function
     Indent OFF:

        PROCEDURE Hello
        PARAMETERS cMsg

        * Print out the message 10 times
        FOR i = 1 TO 10
           ? cMsg
        ENDFOR &&* i = 1 TO 10

        RETURN

     The same code fragment is shown with Function Indent ON:

        PROCEDURE Hello
           PARAMETERS cMsg

           * Print out the message 10 times
           FOR i = 1 TO 10
              ? cMsg
           ENDFOR &&* i = 1 TO 10

           RETURN


   - CASE Indent:  If you like the CASE statements beneath your DO CASE
     structures indented an extra level, set this option ON.  If you
     want your CASE statements to line up directly beneath the DO CASE,
     set it to OFF.  For example, code with CASE Indent set ON will look
     like this:

        DO CASE
           CASE x = 1
              ? "1"
           CASE x = 2
              ? "2"
        ENDCASE

     If CASE Indent is OFF, the same code would be formatted as follows:

        DO CASE
        CASE x = 1
           ? "1"
        CASE x = 2
           ? "2"
        ENDCASE


   - Error Check:  Flow will alert you of mismatched conditionals if you
     set this option ON.  Note that with this option turned ON, Flow
     will stop processing when an error is encountered.  With Error
     Check OFF, Flow ignores any errors.

   - Add Comments:  Conditional commenting is controlled with this
     option.  If you do not want Flow to override comments you have
     already put on the end conditional statement, make sure to turn
     this option OFF.

     The following IF/ENDIF fragment:

        IF cEditor == "TSE"
           WAIT WINDOW "You should be using Quiet Flight!"
        ENDIF

     will look like this after adding a conditional comment:

        IF cEditor == "TSE"
           WAIT WINDOW "You should be using Quiet Flight!"
        ENDIF && cEditor == "TSE"

   - Use Hard Tabs:  Set to ON if you want Flow to insert hard tabs
     rather than spaces for indentation.  This is a life-saver if you
     must work on someone else's code who did not use your preferences.
     Just run the all the .PRGs through Flow to change hard tabs to
     spaces, or vice-versa.


-How We Use Flow-

Flow is different than most pretty-printing programs in that you can run
it on a single procedure/function.  Combined with the fact the Flow is
blazingly FAST, running it on-the-fly is a snap. When our indenting gets
thrown off by adding or removing conditional statements, rather than
trying to re-indent the code by hand, we simply press two keys:  <Alt 3>
and <Enter>.  Voila!  The function is immediately re-indented.


-Configuring Flow-

The default options for Flow may be set in the QF.CFG file.  If you
look under the [FLOW] section in QF.CFG, you will see these options
(provided the default values have not been previously changed):

   - Indent=3
     Set this to the indentation level you wish to use.

   - MultiIndent=2
     Level to indent (beyond the current level) subsequent lines of
     code when a statement spans more than one line

   - FuncIndent=OFF
     ON  = Indent an additional level beneath function headers
     OFF = Start all indentation below header at column 0

   - CaseIndent=ON
     ON  = Indent an extra level beneath the DO CASE
     OFF = Indent CASE statements to same level as DO CASE

   - Errorcheck=ON
     ON  = Flag structural errors
     OFF = Ignore structural errors

   - Comment=ON
     ON  = Add conditional commenting
     OFF = No conditional commenting

   - CommentStr=&&*
     Specify a unique comment prefix to use for conditional comments


ş Color Table           (via QF Menu Alt /)

Can you ever remember the cryptic dBASE color codes? The QF Color Table
eliminates the need to, letting you visually choose colors.  After invoking
the color table, use your cursor keys to move to the color you're
looking for.  Notice how the "Quiet Flight" heading changes to reflect
the current color.

Press the <B> key to toggle blinking colors on/off.

Press <Enter> to insert the color code into your current file.  For
example, suppose you have positioned the cursor on "Bright Cyan on Red"
and pressed <Enter>.  "BG+/R" will be inserted.

<Escape> will exit the QF Color Table without inserting the color code.



ş DBF Structure         <Alt 7>

The DBF Structure macro of Quiet Flight allows you to examine the
structure of your database files "on the fly."  In addition, you can
build field lists and SQL Create Tables for insertion into your program
files.

When DBF Structure is invoked, a picklist of .DBF files is displayed.
Note that Quiet Flight goes to the directory of the current edit file
to retrieve database files.

After selecting a database to view, a menu appears.  Each menu option is
detailed below:

   - Screen Output:  This option creates a file of the database
     structure and displays it in a new horizontal window.  The name of
     the structure file is <filename>.LST, where <filename> is the name
     of the .DBF file.

     The .LST file is not saved to disk unless you explicitly instruct
     TSE Pro to do so.

   - Printer Output:  Quiet Flight will send the database structure
     immediately to the printer when this option is selected.

   - Build Field List:  Select this option to build a comma-delimited
     field list within the current file.  The database structure is
     shown in a pop-up window where you can tag the fields to include in
     this list.  Press <Spacebar> to toggle tagged fields on and off.
     <Enter> will begin the insertion of the selected fields at the
     cursor position, while <Esc> cancels the operation.

     For example, suppose you want to scatter selected fields.  You
     would first type the following in your .PRG file:

        SCATTER FIELDS

     Then, press <Alt 7> to bring up the DBF Structure program, and
     select "Build Field List".  Tag the fields you want to scatter and
     press <Enter>.  If these fields were LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, and CITY,
     your code will now read:

        SCATTER FIELDS LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, CITY

     The fields will always be inserted into the file, regardless of the
     insert/overwrite mode.  Long field lists will be broken at column
     80 with a semi-colon for easier reading.

   - Build SQL Table:  Building an SQL table operates like the "Build
     Field List" option up to the point where you press <Enter>.  After
     tagging the fields and pressing <Enter>, you will be prompted for a
     table name.  Quiet Flight will generate the code for a CREATE TABLE
     using the tagged fields and the table name specified.

     Suppose we tag the fields LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, and CITY.  If we
     name our table "Accounts", the resulting output will be:

        CREATE TABLE Accounts ;
           (Lastname   C(30), ;
            Firstname  C(30), ;
            City       C(25))


ş Index Key Lister        <Alt 6>

    This macro gives you a listing of your index keys.  It doesn't matter
    if they are FoxPro, dBase (II,III,IV) or Clipper - QF index macro will
    work for you.

    After you press Alt-6 or choose Index Key Lister from the QF Menu, you
    will be prompted for the location of the index files.

    Then you will be asked if you would like to process either all the
    indexes (Full Listing) or just one(Partial).  If you choose Partial
    you will have the opportunity to pick the index you would like a
    report on.

    Ú Process All or one? ¿
    ³ Full Listing        ³
    ³ Partial             ³
    ³ Cancel              ³
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

    The next popup will look like this:

    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
    ³ Screen Output        ³
    ³ Printer Output       ³
    ³ Build Index Key List ³
    ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´
    ³ Cancel               ³
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

     Choosing Screen Output will split the screen and load a listing like
     this:

      ALTADDR.CDX (FoxPro)
         Index tag: TRACKID   Key: TRACKID+IIF(CURRENT,"0","1")
         For: .NOT.DELETED()

      EMPLOYEE.MDX (dBASE IV)
         Index tag: CITY   Key: CITY
         Index tag: DEPT   Key: department+lastname+firstname+initial
         Index tag: EMP_ID   Key: emp_id
         Index tag: FIRSTNAME   Key: FIRSTNAME
         Index tag: NAMES   Key: lastname+firstname+initial
         Index tag: STATUS   Key: department+STR(salary,8,2)
         Index tag: YEARS   Key: STR(yrs_exper,4,1)

      CHECKREG.NDX (dBASE III)
         Key: Check_no

      If you had chosen Printer Output, the same screen would have been
      printed instead.

      The last choice, Build Index Key List is really something we use an
      awful lot.  It creates a key list that you could insert in your code.
      This is a sample of the code produced:
       *** ACTIVITY.CDX
       INDEX ON KIND TAG KIND OF ACTIVITY.CDX
       INDEX ON TRACKID TAG TRACKID OF ACTIVITY.CDX
       INDEX ON TRACKID+KIND+STR(VISITNUM)+PARCEL TAG VISITVIEW ;
             OF ACTIVITY.CDX

       *** ALTADDR.CDX
       INDEX ON TRACKID+IIF(CURRENT,"0","1") TAG TRACKID ;
             FOR .NOT.DELETED() OF ALTADDR.CDX

       *** BROKER.CDX
       INDEX ON BROKER TAG BROKER OF BROKER.CDX
       INDEX ON RTRIM(LASTNAME)+", "+FIRSTNAME ;
             TAG NAME OF BROKER.CDX

       *** CHECKLST.CDX
       INDEX ON LASTNAME TAG LASTNAME OF CHECKLST.CDX

       *** COMPANY.CDX
       INDEX ON COMPANY TAG COMPANY OF COMPANY.CDX
       INDEX ON COMPANYID TAG COMPANYID OF COMPANY.CDX

       *** DAILY.CDX
       INDEX ON DTOS(DAILY_DATE)+RTRIM(LASTNAME)+", "+FIRSTNAME ;
             TAG NAME OF DAILY.CDX
       INDEX ON DTOS(DAILY_DATE)+STR(DAILY_NUM,3) TAG NOTRANSFER ;
             FOR .NOT.TRANSFERED OF DAILY.CDX
       INDEX ON DTOS(DAILY_DATE)+SALESASSOC+RTRIM(LASTNAME)+;
             ", "+FIRSTNAME TAG SALESASSOC OF DAILY.CDX
       INDEX ON DTOS(DAILY_DATE)+STR(DAILY_NUM,3) ;
             TAG VISITNUM OF DAILY.CDX

       We think you'll agree, this is a very handy tool.
