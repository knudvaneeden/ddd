Welcome to the Quiet Flight Macros for TSE Pro v2.5

INSTALLATION
컴컴컴컴컴컴

Copy the QF macro files into your TSE Pro macros sub-directory.  Don't worry,
all of our macros start with the letters QF, so you'll be able to
quickly uninstall them with a DEL QF*.*.

** IMPORTANT **
Please set a DOS ENVIRONMENT variable, QFPATH, to your TSE Pro
macros subdirectory.  This is essential for proper
operation.

In your autoexec.bat, insert a line like this:

SET QFPATH=[Your TSE Pro macro sub-directory]

For instance, since our TSE Pro macros are located in C:\TSE\MAC, our
autoexec has:

SET QFPATH=C:\TSE\MAC

You can also type in the QFPATH from the DOS prompt too.  Just type in
what you would have inserted in the Autoexec.bat.

** ANOTHER IMPORTANT! **
Copy the file: QFX.EXE to the TSE Pro macros sub-directory.

To have the QF macros to start up automatically, you have 3 choices:

   - CHOICE 1:

     Edit TSESTART.S  and add the line ExecMacro("QF") in the main()
     procedure.  For instance:
                     proc main()
                          ExecMacro("QF")
                     end main

   - CHOICE 2:

     Edit TSE.UI (or your own User Interface file), search
     for "proc WhenLoaded()" and add the line ExecMacro("QF") just before
     the end of the procedure.  For instance:

        proc WhenLoaded()
            integer cid = GetBufferId()

            pick_buffer = CreateTempBuffer()
            GotoBufferId(cid)
            Hook(_ON_CHANGING_FILES_, OnChangingFiles)
            Hook(_ON_FIRST_EDIT_, OnFirstEdit)
            ExecMacro("QF")   <--- *** ADD THIS LINE ***
        end

      If you choose this route, remember to re-burn your editor in with
      the SC -b[Executable] TSE (or your configuration file).   Here's
      our line, as an example:

          SC -bE TSE

   - CHOICE 3:

     Load QF from your command line using TSE Pro's "-e"
     command-line option.  For example:

        E test.prg -eQF

     You can put this inside a batch file to have TSE Pro always load
     the Quiet Flight macros.

     **  Special Note **

     Please do not use TSE Pro's AUTOLOAD to initialize QF.

To load QF from inside the editor:

   Access the Macro/Execute menu or press the key assigned to
   ExecMacro() (the default is <Ctrl X>).  Then enter "QF" for
   the macro to execute.

BEGIN REGISTERED USERS ONLY:

The source code has been included.  So, you can change the key
assignments to your own preferences.  You'll find the QF key definitions
in QFKEY.INC.  When you modify the key definitions, don't forget to
modify your menu listings in QFMENU.INC.  After any changes you make to
these two files, make sure you recompile QF.S to update the macros.  To
recompile, type in SC QF.S at the DOS prompt.

Remember: To compile your QF macros, we've included a simple batch file
called QFCOMP.BAT.  To recompile your QF macros, change to the
sub-directory where your QF macros are and type in: QFCOMP

END OF REGISTERED USERS ONLY:

** Three Keys to Remember:
   Alt \ will toggle Quiet Flight On and Off.
   Alt / will bring up a menu for the Quiet Flight macros.
   Ctrl F1 will bring up a list of your keyword expansion
   for the current file you are editing.


Thank you for your support.
