            QUIET FLIGHT FOR THE SEMWARE EDITOR PROFESSIONAL
                           INFORMATION SHEET

The Quiet Flight macros for TSE Pro 2.5 create a powerful and efficient
programming environment.   These macros take full advantage of the
expansive macro language of The SemWare Editor Professional.  No matter
what language you program in, you can take advantage of these Quiet
Flight features:

* Shorthand Abbreviations
Quiet Flight employs a flexible command completion and boilerplate
function.  For example, you can insert the following construct in the
Semware macro language (SAL) by typing  IFF<SPACE>:

 	if Name == "Quiet Flight"

	else
	endif // Name == "Quiet Flight"

Or, generate the following C file header by simply entering
HEADER<SPACE>:

/*
* Program....: SAMPLE.C
* Version....: 1.0
* Author.....: Ryan Katri & Randy Wallin
* Date.......: June 19, 1993   Last Modified: 06/19/93 @ 3:42 pm
* Notice.....: Copyright (c) 1993 COB System Designs, Inc.

* Abstract...:
*/

You can customize all function headers, file headers, and command
abbreviations to suit your needs and tastes.  Quiet Flight recognizes
the following keywords in your boilerplate templates, as well as many
others:    Date, DateStr, DOW (day of week), Time, Year, File, Your
Name, Your Company's Name, and Path. You can also setup Quiet Flight to
prompt for fill-in-the-blank fields on the fly.

* Quick Commenter
Commenting out large sections of code with Quiet Flight is a breeze.
Block the section of code to comment out and press a single ALT-key
combination--Quiet Flight automatically determines the type of comment
delimiters to use for that particular file.  You can reverse the
commenting using the same procedure.

* Where Am I?
Do you ever forget the name of the function you are currently positioned
in, and the function prototype isn't visible on-screen?  Press the "5"
key on your numeric keypad and Quiet Flight displays the name of the
current function being edited.


* Window Size
Visually draw a window representation on-screen using a column block and
let Quiet Flight tell you the coordinates of that window.

* Projects / Buffer List
Give a name to a group of related files and let Quiet Flight load them
all at once.  The project mechanism is incorporated seamlessly into TSE
Pro using an enhanced Buffer List. Even if you have no interest in using
projects, Quiet Flight's Buffer List replacement gives you complete
control over the editing ring.

* Directory Lister
Do you wish that directory names be placed at the top of the directory
list in TSE Pro?  That directories be displayed even when a file
specification other than *.* is entered?  Or, perhaps you desire to tag
several files to load?  Quiet Flight's Directory Lister gives you all of
these capabilities.  In addition, you can delete files; view the
contents of text, ZIP, and dBASE .DBF files; and change the sort order.

* Zip Viewer
From within TSE Pro you can manage your .ZIP files using QF's Zip Viewer.
Peek inside the archive, add and delete files, freshen it up, or extract
the contents.  All of these functions are now available to you without
ever leaving your favorite editor.

* Screen Counter
Establish the coordinates of an unknown position relative to another
location on screen using the Quiet Flight screen counter.

* Screen Generator
Drawing screens is a hassle delegated to over-blown user interface
generators.  You can now mock up a screen within TSE Pro and let QF
generate the coordinates.  For example, the following text:

             Full Name: ~name     City: ~City
                                 State: ~State

was converted to this FoxPro / dBase IV code:

DEFINE WINDOW Sample FROM 3, 11 TO 6, 54
ACTIVATE WINDOW Sample
@ 0, 5 SAY "Full Name:"
@ 0, 16 GET name
@ 0, 26 SAY "City:"
@ 0, 32 GET City
@ 1, 25 SAY "State:"
@ 1, 32 GET State


Of course, similar code fragments could be generated for Clipper or TSE
Pro SAL macro language.

*Much More!

* Use the Kill-Restore macro to revert to your original file before
  editing.

* Display file information (date & time, file size, and full pathname)
  with the touch of a key.

* Save all modified files without exiting TSE Pro using the Save All
  Modified macro.

* Return to the line & column where you left off last time for each &
  every file with the QF Restore feature.

dBASE, FoxPro, and Clipper users of Quiet Flight will find some 
additional tools:

* DBF/Index Structures
We go beyond just giving you the structure of a database file.  You can 
also build complete field lists and SQL Create Table commands by simply 
tagging the selected fields. Or, let QF generate the working code for 
re-creating your indexes.  Quiet Flight supports the following index 
formats:  .IDX, .NDX, .NTX, .MDX, and .CDX.  In fact, we include one of
the only DOS utilties we are aware of that correctly reads .CDX files!

* Flow
Never again hand-indent your code.  Quiet Flight will re-indent a single 
procedure or an entire dBASE file.  You can configure the Flow options
to your preferences:  indentation level, hard or soft tabs, add
conditional comments, and more.  Flow will even catch structural errors,
such as a DO WHILE without a matching ENDDO.  And best of all, Flow is
super-fast!

* Color Table
You'll never again have to hunt down your manual to figure out those
cryptic dBASE color codes.  A pop-up table lets you visually select the
color and automatically insert the appropriate foreground/background
combination (such as "W+/BG")

* Update Row/Col
Did you ever have to update a series of SAY's and GET's co-ordinates to
add or remove a field?  It's a time consuming task that QF can handle in
a heartbeat. After highlighting the code to be altered, start QF
Row/Column update , give the adjustment and QF will do the rest.
