ANSI.S
Version 1.1
-
This is an attempt at programming an inter-
preter or viewer for ANSI files for TSE.
Version 1.1 corrects some problems with
cursor positioning contained in the previous
posting.
(Text output did not move the cursor proper-
ly, default parameter values were improperly
interpreted as 0 instead of 1, newlines did
not wrap to column 1.)
There's still the line length limitation to
255 characters maximum.
