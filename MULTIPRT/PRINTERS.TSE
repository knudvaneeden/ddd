;
; Printer Definition File for use with MULTIPRT.S
;
; Format:
;
;   1. Each printer definition must begin with a PrinterName = entry.
;      Each name should be unique, and no name should be the same as
;      an abbreviation for another name.
;
;   2. Other entries should be in the standard form required by TSE
;      in its settings (configuration) file. See TSE doc or help for
;      details.
;
;   3. There are _no_ required entries for a definition; MULTIPRT uses
;      what it finds and leaves the rest as they were.
;
;   4. White space on line is unimportant EXCEPT that each entry must
;      begin in column 1 or it will not be recognized.
;
;   5. Blank lines or comment lines in any format are OK. Just do not
;      add comments to the end of printer entries!
