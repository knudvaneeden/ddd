Author:  David Daniel Anderson (see SWISSTSE.S for contact information)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:    March 6, 1995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History: 1.0 - March 1, 1995   First public release.
         1.1 - March 6, 1995   Removed CALCSRC2.zip archive, replaced with a
                               reference to those macros on the SemWare BBS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terms:   Public domain
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: This package collects, into a single TSE menu, many of the standard
         charts and utilities which programmers find useful.  Most of the
         features were written in SAL - the macro language for The SemWare
         Editor ("TSE").
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:    1) ASCII chart (Decimal & Hex)
             2) Box & line character displays
             3) Color chart (Decimal & Hex)
             4) ANSI help
             5) Key code scan/ chart
             6) Number base conversion utility
             7) Full-featured programmer's calculator
             8) Expression evaluator
             9) Changeable calendar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup:   1) Extract all TSE macro source files (*.s), into your preferred
            TSE macro directory (I suggest c:\tse\mac OR c:\tse\usermac,
            assuming TSE (E.EXE) is in c:\tse\).  If this path is not
            already included in the TSEPath variable in TSE.CFG, you should
            add it, and then burn in your new configuration.

         2) Extract the "SWISS-SC.BAT" batch file into the same directory
            as the source files, and run it to compile the new macros.

         3) Before using the default 'calculator' and 'calendar' features,
            you must first extract the required external programs into a
            directory that is in your PATH.  "C:\TSE\" should be fine.
            The two external programs are:

                 1) WazCalc.exe, in "WazCalc.ZIP"  (public domain)
                 2) Cal.exe, in "Cal100.ZIP"       (freeware)

         4) [Optional] Edit your TSE key assignments, and assign the MENU
            macro for the SwissArmyTool() to a key, like this:

               <Alt F1>   ExecMacro('swisstse')
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:   Either use your assigned key, _OR_ execute "SWISSTSE" directly,
         from within TSE (from the menu or your "ExecMacro()" key).  The
         "SWISSTSE" macro menu provides easy access to *all* of the other
         installed macros and programs.

Legend for "Key" columns of the above feature chart:

   ! = Consists of a stand-alone TSE macro written by DDA, which is
       supplied with the SwissArmyTool package.

   + = Consists of a TSE macro written by DDA, which calls the HELP
       program in either DOS (v5.x or above) or 4DOS.

   * = Consists of either a TSE macro which SemWare supplied with v2.0 of
       TSE, or a TSE macro written by DDA which calls a TSE macro which
       SemWare supplied with v2.0 of TSE.

   $ = Consists of a TSE macro written by DDA, which calls an external
       program, which is either freeware or public domain.  The entire
       archive for the external program is provided in the SwissArmyTool
       archive.  (This applies to both WAZCALC.ZIP and CAL100.ZIP.)

   # = Consists of a TSE macro found in TSE.UI, which SemWare supplied
       with v2.0 of TSE.

   % = Consists of TSE macros found in CALC09.zip (or a later version of
       same), which is a small archive with "The SemWare Editor calculator
       Macros" by L.A.Vonderscheer.
       Floating point support for these macros is provided by Tim Farley.
       These macros are NOT included in the SwissArmyTool v1.1 archive, but
       can be found on the SemWare BBS (phone 1-404-641-8968).

Note:    To use any of the mentioned alternatives:

         1) extract the source code into the same directory as the rest
            of the macros;
         2) edit the MENU in SWISSTSE.S to reflect the alternative;
         3) compile both SWISSTSE.S and the source for the alternative
            feature.

Further information on setting up or using each of the included macros can
be found in the first few lines of that macro, or in the nested archive in
which it was stored.
