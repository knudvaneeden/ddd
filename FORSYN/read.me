These three files are SyntaxHilite Mapping files (.SYN) to support Fortran
source files for TSE Pro/32:

  FOR.SYN    For FORTRAN-77  (file extension .for or .f)
  F90.SYN    For Fortran-90  (file extension .f90)
  F95.SYN    For Fortran-95  (file extension .f95)

File FOR.SYN (for FORTRAN-77) requires TSE Pro/32 v3.0 or later, since it
uses the column-dependent comment feature.  This file is also suitable
for use with FORTRAN-66 source files.

Files F90.SYN and F95.SYN (for Fortran-90 and Fortran-95, respectively)
should work with TSE Pro/32 version 2.8 or later.  They support Fortran-90/95
free-format source code.  Files F90.SYN and F95.SYN are identical, except
that F95.SYN includes the new Fortran-95 keywords ELEMENTAL, FORALL, and PURE.

To install, place the files into your Syntax Hiliting directory (typically
C:\TSE32\SYNHI), the select under the TSE/32 "Options" menu:

"Full Configuration" -> "Display/Color Options" -> Configure SyntaxHilite
Mapping Sets" -> "Other...".

Select the appropriate .SYN file, then select "Associated File Extensions..."
and provide the desired file extension(s).
