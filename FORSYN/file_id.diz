(12-03-01) SyntaxHilite files for TSE Pro/32
Three SyntaxHilite Mapping files (.SYN) to
support Fortran source files for TSE Pro/32:

FOR.SYN     For FORTRAN-77  (.for or .f ext)
F90.SYN     For Fortran-90  (.f90 ext)
F95.SYN     For Fortran-95  (.f95 ext)

FOR.SYN requires TSE Pro/32 v3.0 or later,
since it uses the column-dependent comment
feature.  This file is also suitable for use
with FORTRAN-66 source files.

Files F90.SYN and F95.SYN (for Fortran-90 and
Fortran-95, respectively) should work with
TSE Pro/32 version 2.8 or later. They support
Fortran-90/95 free-format source code.  Files
F90.SYN and F95.SYN are identical, except
that F95.SYN includes the new Fortran-95
keywords ELEMENTAL, FORALL, and PURE.

See read.me file for instructions.
