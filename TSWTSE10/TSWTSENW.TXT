Sun 9-Jan-2005: Ever since the days of MS-DOS my favorite text
editor has been the SemWare Editor (TSE) and its SemWare
Applications Language (SAL). I have previously written a SAL macros
collection for the editor's versions 2.0 and 2.5 for MS-DOS. I have
prepared those same macros and a few additions as a new collection
hereby released as
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tswtse10.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor 4.0+
Since the origins of these macros go far back expect some redundancy
in my collection compared to what is now included by default in The
SemWare editor.
