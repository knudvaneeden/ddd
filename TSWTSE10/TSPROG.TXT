A list of program and other packages by Timo Salmi
==================================================

If you have an access to the Internet, and have FTP  (file  transfer
program)  or WWW (World Wide Web) capability, you can download these
programs from the Garbo garbo.uwasa.fi archives at the University of
Vaasa, Finland, by anonymous FTP. If you use WWW the relevant URL is
http://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts.html

Although Garbo archives  probably  still  are  mirrored  by  several
sites,  there  is  no  absolute  guarantee  that the material at the
mirrors will be up to date. Thus it is  best  to  get  the  material
directly from the original Garbo source.

Comments  and  feedback  are  welcome.  Please note, however, that I
can't afford the time to process any correspondence sent to  me  via
the  ordinary (paper) mail. Furthermore, if you consider sending any
questions by email to me you should first take a very  careful  look
at http://www.uwasa.fi/~ts/garbo.html#faqtimo
