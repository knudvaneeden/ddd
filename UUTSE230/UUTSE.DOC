TSE Pro/32 v2.x

by Fabio Ferrero

This package contains macros to decode and encode files,
for TSE Pro v2.5 and TSE Pro/32 2.x.

UUDEC.MAC is a decode macro, it's decode an encoded file with UU, XX or
    MIME64 method into original archive. To decode a file, simply load
    it with TSE, then execute my macro and follow the menus. Now this
    macro tries to autodetect the encoded method (uuencoded, xxencoded
    or MIME64) by analizing file content (not file extension).

UUENC.MAC is a encode macro, it's encode a file into UU, XX or MIME64
    encoded file. To encode a file, run my macro, then follow the menus
    and select method. Encoded file is written to disk and not loaded
    into TSE, but it's added to edit history list.

UUTSE.S is a simple menu to select decode or encode. You can add it to
    autoload list. Compile it with SC UUTSE for normal macro load, or
    with SC -dFAST=1 UUTSE to load UUENC and UUDEC macro at startup
    (please check the source file).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My macros are compatible with:

- mpack/munpack version 1.5, available from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu into
  directory pub/mpack/

- uudeview/uuenview version 0.4pl17, written by Frank Pilhofer,
  available at www http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~fp/uudeview/

- uuexe version 5.40 written by Richard Marks.
  WARNING!!!
  UUEXE encode program use '-' character instead of '/' in MIME64, my
  macro correctly decode it, but uses standard '/' character in encoding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future features:

- add INI file to save options and preferences
