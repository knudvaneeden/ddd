    I have done very little work with the SE macro language so these macros
are mostly brute force and very little finesse.  They were hacked to get the
job done.  I am a 'die hard' WordStar command key user, so the first thing I
did was to strip out all the menues and assign things to key strokes.  Anyone
who can give some elegance to these macros, and kill bytes is more than
welcome.  I don't have time to go online often, but I do read my mail.

To SEMWARE:  I would love to be able to have room on the status line to
             implement uses defined toggles. I would not mind a truncating
             the path/file area.
