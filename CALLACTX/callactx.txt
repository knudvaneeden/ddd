                         The "Call ActiveX" Project

Author:  Christopher Shuffett

Introduction:
The intent is to create a TSE compatible custom DLL written in C++ using
Microsoft Visual C++ version 6 that can interface with the Microsoft
ScriptControl and thus VBScript and the world of ActiveX.  This is to be
open source project to be maintained by the TSE user community as freeware.

Project Definition:
The DLL will provide these three functions.  It will implement a Jscript
function to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  It will
render an HTML document using the Microsoft Internet Explorer.  It will
transform an XML document into an HTML document using a XSL stylesheet and
render it using the Microsoft Internet Explorer.  The DLL will have the
absolute minimum number of library dependencies and will not impact the
Windows registry.

Project Status:
The development has drawn heavily upon the work done by Ernest Laurentin who
wrote the article, "Adding VBScript and JScript support in your C++
applications", found on The Code Project website,
<http://www.codeproject.com/com/ScriptDemo.asp>.   In order to produce a
clean compile without adding the MFC libraries, several lines in the modules
used from Ernest's project had to be commented out and still need to be
re-coded.  To assist with debugging, code was added to pass data from the
DLL to TSE via the Windows clipboard.  The resulting DLL does not yet have
the ability to interface with the Microsoft ScriptControl object.
