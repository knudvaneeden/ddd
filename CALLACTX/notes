We want to add the temperature conversion function in order to provide a model
function call. It should be easy to extract this from the ScriptDemo project.
What is the best way to return real numbers to TSE?

IE.vbs is a sample VBScript application to show how to invoke IE to render an
HTML document.

XML.vbs is a sample VBScript application to show how to transform XML using
XSL.  Requires IE 5.0 or above.

TSE needs to be able to pass documents to this application.  Could be passed as
strings or file handles.  Possible functions to implement would be:
RenderHTML(htmldoc), PutXML(xmldoc), PutXSL(xsldoc), and RenderXML(XSLtrue).
XSLtrue is a boolean to indicate whether to apply the loaded xsldoc or
defaultss.

In order to create a formated display of XML documents, IE knows to apply
defaultss.xsl so we may want to to duplicate that behavior in our application.
When XSLtrue is false defaultss could be loaded into a DOMDocument using the
load method.  Example: xsldoc.load "res://msxml.dll/DEFAULTSS.XSL"
