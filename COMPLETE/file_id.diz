<10-01-05> v1.2 - COMPLETE macro for TSE Pro/32.
This macro will 'complete' a word based on
the starting letters. Similar to Semware's
Expand.s but doesn't display a picklist.
Extremely useful when trying to recall a
constant or variable used elsewhere in your
loaded files. It also finds two word
sequences. To try it add it to your Autoload
list and restart TSE. Type the letters 'pro'
and then hit <Ctrl h> to cycle through the
existing word completions. Hit <Alt h> to
reverse the cycle. Works in both GUI and
Console editors.
