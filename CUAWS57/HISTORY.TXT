CUAWS: CUA Macro/WordStar UI for TSE Pro/32
(C) 1997-2004 by Bill Stewart (bstewart@iname.com)

Version History

>  Version 5.7 (03/10/04):

   o  Updated for TSE Pro/32 v4.2 (console and GUI versions).

   o  Interactive "open a file" commands now use EditThisFile() instead of
      EditFile(). This eliminates the need to quote filenames containing
      spaces unless you intend to specify multiple filenames (new in 4.2).

   o  Changed several standard keystrokes to use the Windows clipboard:

      o  Shift-Ins now performs PasteFromWinClip()
      o  Ctrl-Ins now performs CopyToWinClip()
      o  Shift-Del now performs CutToWinClip()

      The CUA macro also uses the above keystrokes to work with the Windows
      clipboard.

   o  Added left mouse button marking to UI.

   o  Added Ctrl-X and Shift-Del to prompt boxes.

   o  Added Ctrl-K, Ctrl-O, and Ctrl-Q HelpLine menus (new in 4.2).

   o  Added C# as a language and added 'try', 'catch', and 'finally' as
      language keywords.

   o  Updated WORDSTAR.UI based on the 4.2 TSE.UI file.

   o  Added mReplace() macro to CUA.S. Basically, if you mark a CUA block
      and then press Ctrl-QA or Ctrl-R, it will do a replace operation, but
      will add 'gl' to the replace options for your convenience, and it
      will leave the block marked as it was.

>  Version 5.6 (06/11/02):

   o  Updated for TSE Pro/32 v4.0 (console and GUI versions).

   o  The "Save As" menu item now invokes the editor's internal
      RenameAndSaveAs() command.

   o  The UI now implements the editor's internal TabShiftsBlock editor
      variable. Changed from the previous version: The block will not be
      shifted if insert mode is off.

   o  The CUA block-marking menu is now located on the Block menu rather
      than the Text menu.

   o  The ToggleAppWindowSize macro command has been removed; the editor
      will instead execute the TOGMAX external macro that ships with the
      editor (ToggleMaximizedWindow).

   o  The mSaveBlock command was removed and the standard editor behavior
      used instead.

   o  Several of the prompt boxes are augmented with a list of commands
      along the bottom to remind of useful keystrokes.

   o  The mouse wheel is functional in the GUI version of the editor.

   o  You can "right-click and drag" to mark a column block.

   o  Added keys: F8 = shell, Alt-F8 = OS command.

   o  The CUA macro now supports Ctrl-A to mark the entire file. The cursor
      is placed at the bottom of the file. If you pressed Ctrl-A by
      mistake, you can use Ctrl-QP to return to your previous position.

>  Version 5.5 (04/18/02):

   o  CUA block-marking macro updated to support persistent blocks and a
      configuration menu. The UI now configures the macro using the menu.

   o  Updated VB function string and filename extensions (added .cls and
      .frm)--thanks to Howard Kapustein.

   o  Added .tex support (thanks to Sjoerd Rienstra).

>  Version 5.0 (04/10/01):

   o  Updated for TSE Pro/32 v3.0.

   o  Fixed some possible template macro loading issues.

   o  VIEW macro no longer needed thanks to browse mode. Ctrl-OP toggles
      browse mode.

   o  Added Upper (Ctrl-K", Ctrl-U) and Lower (Ctrl-K', Ctrl-L) command
      support to prompt boxes.

   o  Prompt boxes support quotation mark toggling with Ctrl-' as well as
      Ctrl-KU.

   o  CUA macro now deletes the entire contents of the prompt box if you
      enter a typable keystroke into the prompt box when it first appears.
      (This is like "Typing replaces block," but "typing replaces block" is
      otherwise ignored.)

   o  Mouse marking bug fix added to CUA macro.

   o  Removed "Revert to saved" command now that Undo/Redo are available.

   o  ChangeDirectory command (Ctrl-KG) now calls the CD macro, and is
      located on the File menu.

   o  OpenSwitch command (Ctrl-OK) removed. Ctrl-OK now calls
      OpenFileAndWindow instead.

   o  The FlushRight command now calls the ADJUST external macro.

   o  EmptyClipboard (Empty the System Clipboard) no longer generates a
      prompt.

   o  Added Next, Previous, and Change Dir commands to the File menu, and
      removed the Revert to Saved command. This required changing the
      shortcut keystrokes on the menu a bit. Also fixed duplicate quick-
      key keystrokes on several of the menus.

   o  Ctrl-KF now opens the File Manager.

   o  Added View Windows Clipboard to the Clip menu.

   o  Added keystrokes:

      o  CtrlShift-B wraps and "quotes" a paragraph with ">"
      o  CtrlShift-L now does repeatfind(_REVERSE_), like TSE.UI
      o  Alt-Backspace executes the undo command
      o  AltShift-Backspace executes the redo command
      o  Ctrl-KO displays the named clipboards menu
      o  Ctrl-O[ does flush left
      o  Ctrl-OP toggles browse mode

   o  Menus updated to be sensitive to browse mode.

   o  Added support for Python files (.py) for SmartIndent mode and the
      FunctionList command.

>  Version 4.4 (02/23/01):

   o  Modified language keyword list to include 'select' and 'with' (for VB
      files).

   o  Modified program extension lists to include .kix (KiXtart) and .vbs
      (VBScript). KiXtart functions are located in the same manner as batch
      files (a label starting at column 1).

   o  .pp (Free Pascal) and .dpr (Delphi project) files are considered to
      be Pascal source files, and .cmd files are considered to be batch
      files.

   o  Added .vbs, .kix, and .pl to the list of extensions that are affected
      by SmartIndent mode.

   o  .vbs files are supported by the FunctionList command. .bas files are
      considered the same as .vbs files.

   o  Added the SmartIndent section to the documentation.

   o  The "Revert to Saved" command is implemented as an external macro.

   o  HelpOnWordAtCursor now works with marked blocks. That is, if you mark
      a block and press <Ctrl F1>, the help system will attempt to use the
      marked block as the word to search for. For example, if you mark the
      two words "SyntaxHilite Mode" (without the quotes) and press <Ctrl
      F1>, the help system will jump immediately to the correct topic.

   o  <CtrlShift B> now wraps a paragraph with quote characters. This
      requires the updated WRAPPARA macro, which Sammy Mitchell posted to
      the news.semware.com news server in October 1998. <CtrlShift B>
      executes the command ExecMacro("wrappara quote") to support this new
      feature. If you don't install the new macro, <CtrlShift B> will act
      just like <Ctrl B>.

>  Version 4.3 (01/09/98):

   o  Added the ChangeDirectory command to WORDSTAR.UI (Ctrl-KG).

   o  Added PrevFile, NextFile, and ChangeDirectory to the key assignments
      list inside WORDSTAR.UI, and corrected the version number and date in
      the key assignments screen.

   o  Added a "hex view" mode to VIEW.S. Note that the hexadecimal and
      "normal" view of the file are not synchronized.

   o  Corrected some errors in the comments at the top of CUA.S.

>  Version 4.2a (01/02/98):

   o  ToggleAppWindowSize command no longer executed when you start the
      editor without any command-line parameters.

>  Version 4.2 (08/14/97):

   o  WORDSTAR.UI requires TSE Pro/32 v2.8. CUA.S requires TSE Pro/32 v2.6
      or later, and VIEW.S works with 2.5 or later.

   o  CUAWS is now split into separate files: WORDSTAR.UI, CUA.S, and
      VIEW.S.

   o  Pull-down menu system changes:

      o  WORDSTAR.UI's menu system has been changed back to the defaults
         found in TSE.UI (except for the necessary changes and additions);
         this change was made so the F1 key invokes the proper help items
         when the pull-down are active.

      o  Many menu items are appropriately "grayed out" (inactive) when
         executing them would have no effect; for example, "Unmark" under
         the Block menu is grayed (inactive) if a block is not marked.

      o  On/Off menu items (e.g. Line Drawing on the Util menu) are now
         represented on the pull-down menus with check marks. A check mark
         next to the menu item indicates "On," and the absence of the check
         mark indicates "Off." The pull-down menus haven't changed for
         options that have more than three settings.

      o  Many of the On/Off commands on the pull-down menus execute
         immediately (e.g. they don't leave the pull-down menu active)--for
         example, Line Drawing, Template Expansion, etc.

      o  Some of the quick-keys on the pull-down menus are different to
         accommodate new menu items.

      o  Some pull-down menu items have been removed (to conserve screen
         space) and some have been renamed.

      o  Keystroke changes:

         Keystroke  Old Command             New Command
         ------------------------------------------------------------
         Ctrl-Up    PrevPara                RollUp
         Ctrl-Down  NextPara                RollDown
         Ctrl-[     (nothing)               ShiftLeft
         Ctrl-]     (nothing)               ShiftRight
         Ctrl-0     (nothing)               ListRecentFiles
         Ctrl-KI    Toggle PersistentBlock  Toggle ColumnOverlay mode
         Ctrl-KN    Set BlockType           Toggle ColumnBlock mode
         Ctrl-O+    LineTypeMenu            (nothing)
         Ctrl-O-    (nothing)               ToggleLineDrawing
         Ctrl-O=    ToggleLineDrawing       (nothing)
         Ctrl-OF    RedisplayViewPickList   FunctionList
         Ctrl-OG    (nothing)               PrevFile
         Ctrl-OP    PrevFile                Viewer
         Ctrl-OZ    (nothing)               Toggle app window size
         Ctrl-OU    FunctionList            (nothing)
         Ctrl-QV    (nothing)               RedisplayViewPickList

   o  "Empty Clipboard" is a new command on the Clip menu.

   o  "Tab Shifts Block" is a new option on the Options menu.

   o  "EOF Type" is a new option on the Options menu.

   o  "SyntaxHilite Mode" is a new command on the Util menu.

   o  "CUA Block Marking" and "Typing Replaces Block" are two new options
      under the Text pull-down menu.

   o  "Save As" now works when a file is in binary mode.

   o  BlockType and PersistentBlock are now obsolete.

   o  You can toggle the quotation marks around a string of text inside a
      prompt box by executing the QuoteLine command (Ctrl-KU).

   o  You can execute the ListRecentFiles (Ctrl-0) command inside prompt
      boxes.

   o  The RevertToSaved command ("Revert to Saved" under the File menu)
      keeps track of your position in the file.

   o  The case-changing commands (Upper, Lower, Flip and Capitalize) now
      operate on the current word if no block is marked.

   o  Many of the prompts, warnings, and informational messages are
      displayed in message boxes.

   o  Key assignments help text has been enhanced to include "bold" text
      and links to help topics.

   o  If StartupFlags is set to _STARTUP_MENU_, the ToggleAppWindowSize
      command is automatically executed on startup. (This is handy when you
      run the editor from the desktop...)

   o  The CUA macro supports the "typing replaces block" behavior of
      Windows applications. For example, suppose you press <Shift End> to
      open a CUA-style block and extend it to the end of the current line.
      The next alphabetic character you type will delete the block and
      replace it with the character you typed. You can toggle this behavior
      by choosing "Typing Replaces Block" under the Text menu. If this
      setting is OFF, the next character you type does not cause the CUA-
      style block to be deleted.

   o  When the CUA macro is active, the Find, Again, and IncrementalSearch
      commands mark found text as a CUA-style block, and they can also
      extend a block through the found text.

>  Version 4.1:

   o  Startup Menu support for DOS version (set StartupFlags to 0).

   o  Ctrl-KF command executes the Dos command in 2.5 and FileManager in
      2.6.

   o  HelpSystem uses keydef so Ctrl-Home/Ctrl-End work properly.

>  Version 4.0:

   o  First portable version (works with 2.5/2.6/2.8).

   o  Added "persistent block" setting (now obsolete).

   o  Store deleted non-persistent CUA-style blocks in deletion buffer.

   o  Fixed a bug in prompt box processing.

   o  Several new commands added.
