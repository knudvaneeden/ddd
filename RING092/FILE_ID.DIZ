Ringlets v0.9.2 (Jun 19, 2002):


Ringlets lets you have multiple rings of files in
TSE. It's like having multiple virtual editors
inside of a single editing session!

You can use these rings for whatever purpose you
like. Here are some common uses:

* Load several large multi-file projects, and keep
them all independent by putting each into a
separate ring. Unlike using separate instances of
TSE, files common to both projects will only be
loaded into TSE once.  A simple project loader
macro (LoadProj) is included.

* During an editing session you can create a
temporary ring containing just a couple of
frequently-used files so you can switch back and
forth between them easily.

* Newly edited files get filtered into their own
ring based on file type (this is very powerful
when used with the OnlyOne macro: for instance you
could use TSE as your web browser's source viewer,
and have all these files go into a separate ring).

* You can create an Instant Filter: a new ring which
contains a subset of files in the current ring,
based on file type.  For instance, you could
create an Instant Filter to list all files in the
current ring which have the extension ".txt".

Some other features:

* Buffer lists can switch between displaying
filename only, or the full path.  Additionally,
you can setup plugin macros to display a friendly
name for certain files (e.g. the <title> of an
HTML file). Plugins for HTML files and Perl
modules are included.

* Sort each ring's buffer list alphabetically.
Tweak the order by moving individual files up and
down in the list.

* Editing variables (tab type, margins, etc) and the
current directory are saved separately in each
ring.

* Files can be in more than one ring at once.  The
built-in virtual [all] ring contains every loaded
file. The [unfiled] ring contains files that
aren't in any other user-defined ring.

* The Find or Replace 'all files' option is now
limited to search only the files in the current
ring.  If you want to search every loaded file,
you can use the [all] ring).
