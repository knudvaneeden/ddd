    LoadProj - Simple Project loader for the Ringlets system

    1. INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    LoadProj is a simple project loader designed to work well with
    the Ringlets system.

    Basically, you give it a file which contains a list of files,
    and it will load each of those files into the editor.

    In this way it's similar to the ldflist macro that ships with TSE,
    except that it has some additional features:

      * lines in the file can contain wildcards (e.g. c:\projects\*.txt)
         - all matching files in this directory are loaded
         - if the line begins with the '@' character, then LoadProj will
           recursively load all matching files in this directory
           and all of its subdirectories.

      * lines beginning with the semi-colon (;) or the hash (#) are ignored.

      * If the file contains INIfile-style sections in it, then
        LoadProj will ONLY load files in the [editfiles] section.
        (This feature allows you to put other information in your
        project files to be used by other systems)

      * If, in the list of filespecs, there is a line in the form
        of:
            ; ring: ring name

        Then that ring becomes current for the files that follow.

      * If the file contains a [rings] section, then this section
        is used to define the properties of a rings to be used with
        the project.

    See the EXAMPLES section for some sample LoadProj project files.

    Macro Usage:
      loadproj -s <filespec>  // loads single filespec (e.g. loadproj *.txt)
      loadproj <file>         // loads all filespecs listed in <file>
      loadproj                // loads all filespecs listed in current buffer

    Usage from the command line:
      c:\tse32\e32.exe -eloadproj -s <filespec>
      c:\tse32\e32.exe -eloadproj <file>


    2. INSTALLATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Place loadproj.s, into your macro source directory
    (e.g. c:\tse32\mac).  Compile it.

    If you want to be able to double-click on project files in Windows
    Explorer, and have your projects start up in TSE, then you can
    do the following:

    Edit the LoadProj.reg file included in this distribution.
    At the end of the file there should be a line that points
    to the TSE executable on your system.  Make sure that this
    is correct.

        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\proj_auto_file\shell\open\command]
        @="C:\\tse32\\e32.exe -eloadproj %1"

    If you installed TSE to a directory containing spaces (e.g.
    somewhere in C:\Program Files), then you will need to quote
    that path (Note that the interior quotes are preceded
    by backslashes):

        [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\proj_auto_file\shell\open\command]
        @="\"C:\Program Files\system\editors\tse32\e32.exe\" -eloadproj %1"

    When you are finished, save the file, and double-click it
    in Windows Explorer.  Answer that yes, you would like to import
    these settings into the registry.

    Now navigate to a .proj file in Windows Explorer.  Double-click
    it (or move the cursor to it and press Enter).  TSE should
    pop up with a project containing all your files.

    For extra fun, try this with the OnlyOne macro.  The OnlyOne macro
    forces TSE to keep only a single instance of itself in Windows.

    When you double-click on a .proj file, the single instance of
    TSE will come to the foreground and load all of your project files
    into their own protected ring.

    The OnlyOne macro was written by Rick VanNorman, and is maintained
    by me.  You can get it either on Semware's FTP site:

    3. EXAMPLES
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    a) Project_X.proj: simple list of files (using absolute paths):

        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Readme.txt
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Macro_1.s
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Macro_2.s
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Batchfile.bat
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\tests\*.*
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Changes
        c:\data\projects\Project_X\Project_X.proj

    b) Project_X.proj: same, but using relative paths:

        Readme.txt
        Macro_1.s
        Macro_2.s
        Batchfile.bat
        tests\*.*
        Changes
        Project_X.proj

    c) Project_X.proj: same, but using a simple recursive filespec:

         @c:\data\projects\Project_X\*.*

    d) Project_Y.proj: all files will be loaded into a ring named "Project Y":

         [editfiles]
         ; ring: Project Y
         Readme.txt
         Macro_1.s
         Macro_2.s
         Batchfile.bat
         tests\*.*
         Project_Y.proj

    d) Project_Y.proj: same files will be loaded into the "Project X"
       ring, but we also give some properties to that ring:

         [rings]
         Project Y=names_only:1,enable_view_plugins:1,use_currext:1,steal:0

         [editfiles]
         ; ring: Project Y
         Readme.txt
         Macro_1.s
         Macro_2.s
         Batchfile.bat
         tests\*.*
         Project_Y.proj

    d) Project_Z.proj: We use two rings, one for programs one for docs:

         [rings]
         Project Z Docs and Tests=names_only:1,enable_view_plugins:1,use_currext:1,steal:0
         Project Z Code=names_only:1,enable_view_plugins:1,use_currext:1,steal:0

         [editfiles]
         ; ring: Project Z Code
         Project_X.s
         Project_Y.s
         Project_Z.bat
         ; ring: Project Z Docs and Tests
         Readme.txt
         tests\*.*
         Project_X.proj
