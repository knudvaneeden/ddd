TSE Jr. macro to PGP encrypt and sign a file

It was included in TSE 'pgp032.zip' which is the TSE link to PGP and is
much more robust than the TSE Jr. macro below.

It needs work since is uses a RamDisk that the user may not have or the
RamDisk is a different logical drive.  Also filenames need work('aa' and
'bb' filenames have been picked out of the air).               \\\...tak

                       Subj:  TSE Jr. macro for PGP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      * plaintext message signed/encrypted with PGP (whole msg)

@F11  MacroBegin SetScreenOff SaveFile UnMarkBlock WriteBlock
      "d:\aa" Return Dos "pgp -se" Return Return BegFile MarkLine
      EndFile Cut ReadBlock "d:\bb" Return UnMarkBlock EndFile
      Find "END PGP" Return "b" Return EndLine DelCh 2

  Writes/reads from a ramdisk.  Obviously the -se part can be changed
 to just -s or just -e to sign *or* decrypt, and not both, or Input or
 something stuck in to grab a choice of switches.
