   Here's a quick summary of PGP v2.3 commands generated by 'pgp -h'.

This file also contains any hints from E-mail and any other tidbits.
TAK's TSE macro for encryption using PGP is called 'pgp.s'
To search just past this -help- information search for '// start *TidBits'

To encrypt a plaintext file with the recipient's public key:
     pgp -e textfile her_userid

To sign a plaintext file with your secret key:
     pgp -s textfile [-u your_userid]

To sign a plaintext file with your secret key, and then encrypt it
with the recipient's public key:
     pgp -es textfile her_userid [-u your_userid]

To encrypt a plaintext file with just conventional cryptography, type:
     pgp -c textfile

To decrypt an encrypted file, or to check the signature integrity of a
signed file:
     pgp ciphertextfile [-o plaintextfile]

To encrypt a message for any number of multiple recipients:
     pgp -e textfile userid1 userid2 userid3

--- Key management commands:

To generate your own unique public/secret key pair:
     pgp -kg

To add a public or secret key file's contents to your public or
secret key ring:
     pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]

To extract (copy) a key from your public or secret key ring:
     pgp -kx userid keyfile [keyring]
or:  pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]

To view the contents of your public key ring:
     pgp -kv[v] [userid] [keyring]

To view the "fingerprint" of a public key, to help verify it over
the telephone with its owner:
     pgp -kvc [userid] [keyring]

To view the contents and check the certifying signatures of your
public key ring:
     pgp -kc [userid] [keyring]

To edit the userid or pass phrase for your secret key:
     pgp -ke userid [keyring]

To edit the trust parameters for a public key:
     pgp -ke userid [keyring]

To remove a key or just a userid from your public key ring:
     pgp -kr userid [keyring]


To sign and certify someone else's public key on your public key ring:
     pgp -ks her_userid [-u your_userid] [keyring]

To remove selected signatures from a userid on a keyring:
     pgp -krs userid [keyring]

To permanently revoke your own key, issuing a key compromise
certificate:
     pgp -kd your_userid

To disable or reenable a public key on your own public key ring:
     pgp -kd userid

--- Esoteric commands:

To decrypt a message and leave the signature on it intact:
     pgp -d ciphertextfile

To create a signature certificate that is detached from the document:
     pgp -sb textfile [-u your_userid]

To detach a signature certificate from a signed message:
     pgp -b ciphertextfile

--- Command options that can be used in combination with other
command options (sometimes even spelling interesting words!):

To produce a ciphertext file in ASCII radix-64 format, just add the
-a option when encrypting or signing a message or extracting a key:
     pgp -sea textfile her_userid
or:  pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]

To wipe out the plaintext file after producing the ciphertext file,
just add the -w (wipe) option when encrypting or signing a message:
     pgp -sew message.txt her_userid

To specify that a plaintext file contains ASCII text, not binary, and
should be converted to recipient's local text line conventions, add
the -t (text) option to other options:
     pgp -seat message.txt her_userid

To view the decrypted plaintext output on your screen (like the
Unix-style "more" command), without writing it to a file, use
the -m (more) option while decrypting:
     pgp -m ciphertextfile

To specify that the recipient's decrypted plaintext will be shown
ONLY on her screen and cannot be saved to disk, add the -m option:
     pgp -steam message.txt her_userid

To recover the original plaintext filename while decrypting, add
the -p option:
     pgp -p ciphertextfile

To use a Unix-style filter mode, reading from standard input and
writing to standard output, add the -f option:
     pgp -feast her_userid <inputfile >outputfile
