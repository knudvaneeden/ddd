UnixEdit v0.1.5 (Jun 19, 2002):


Type "e /etc/passwd" on your Unix system,
and the file appears in your Windows TSE
editing session!

This package consists of a shell script on the
Unix side, and a watcher macro on the TSE side.

For this package to work you will need a
samba share on the Linux/Unix system, and
access to this share from the machine
running TSE.  You do not need to share
the entire Unix filesystem; just a single
directory will do.


Platform: TSE 3.x only

Requirements: none
