This is the first stab at one solution to the age old question of
"How do I use TSE as my Unix editor?"

Of course you can't actually run the TSE32 program at the Unix
console yet, but this macro does allow you to transparently use TSE as
your Linux/Unix editor.  All you need is a Samba share on your
Linux/Unix box that is accessible from your Windows box.

Here's how it works:

At your shell prompt on your Unix box (using your Windows telnet/ssh
program), you run the shell script "e.sh".  This script creates
some temporary files in a special directory on the Samba share.

Meanwhile, on your Windows box, your primary instance of TSE is running
a macro in the background which is constantly monitoring this directory
waiting for new files to appear.  When it finds a file, it loads it, and
brings TSE to the foreground.

So for example, if you type at your shell prompt:

    $ e /etc/passwd

The following things happen:

    1) The shell script makes a copy in /data/autoedit/passwd.
    2) TSE notices the file on the windows side (w:\autoedit\passwd)
    3) TSE loads the file and brings itself to the foreground.
    4) You edit the file, make some changes, then quit it
    5) TSE saves the file, then brings your terminal
       window to the foreground.
    6) The shell script notices that the file has changed
       and copies /data/autoedit/passwd to /etc/passwd,
       (even offering to use the sudo command, if necessary)

It sounds complicated, but it's actually quite easy from the user's
point of view.

Of course it only really works with one file at a time, and it doesn't
really handle very well multiple files in different directories with
the same name.  But it's a start.

Eventually, I want to package this up into a proper macro package,
and upload it to Semware's FTP site but I wanted to get some feedback
from the newsgroup first.

So if any of you try this out or have any comments or suggestions
please let me know.

There are two files in this package:

    e.sh       (unix shell script)
    autoedit.s (TSE macro)

To use them, you will first have to create a directory in your samba
share. On my system this is:

     Under Linux         Under Windows
     -----------         -------------
     /data/autoedit      w:\autoedit


You will then have to edit both autoedit.s and e.sh to point
to the share.

In autoedit.s search for the line:

    string Watch_Directory[MAX_PATH] = 'w:\autoedit'

And in e.sh, search for the line:

    WATCH_DIR=/data/autoedit
