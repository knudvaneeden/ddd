                                    INI.MAC
                                    -------


        SUMMARY
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

            This macro allows several macros to share a single common
        .INI file. Each macro can have its own section in the .INI file,
        and can update its settings indenpendent of other macros'
        settings.

            A section in the .INI file begins with a marker string
        between brackets. For example, a section might begin like this:
        "[Bullet]". The marker string can be the name of the macro, or
        something more elaborate like "[Bullet - bullet and outlining
        macro]".

            A section ends either at the end of the file, or at the
        beginning of the next section.

            Each line in a section can either be a comment line (comment
        lines start with a semicolon, ";") or a key line. A key line
        consists of a keyname followed by an equal sign, followed by a
        value. An example section for a macro might look like this:

            [AutoSignature]
            UserName=Eric Frank Russell
            Initials=er
            Signatures=3
            Signature1=Yours Truly,
            Signature2=Best Wishes,
            Signature3=Thank You For Your Time,

     ** NOTE: Section names and keynames are not case sensitive and may
        only contain letters, digits, spaces, and the underscore; other 
        characters may generate unpredictable results. Values may 
        contain any characters except the linefeed character (Chr(10)), 
        the carriage return (Chr(13)), or the NUL character (Chr(0)).



        USING INI IN YOUR MACROS
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

            To use INI, you'll need to include INI.SI in your macro.
        Then you'll be able to use the following functions:


        GetIniStr, GetIniInt ------------------------------------------

        string proc GetIniStr(string section, string keyname)
        integer proc GetIniInt(string section, string keyname)

            To get a keyname's value, use these functions. You can get
        string and integer values using these functions. If a keyname
        cannot be found, an empty string or 0 is returned. Example:

            string section[] = "AutoSignature"
            string s[80]
            integer numsigs
            s = GetIniStr(section, "UserName")
            numsigs = GetIniInt(section, "Signatures")


        SetIniStr, SetIniInt ------------------------------------------

        proc SetIniStr(string section, string keyname, string value)
        proc SetIniInt(string section, string keyname, integer value)

            To set a keyname's value, use these functions. You can set
        string and integer values using these functions. (If a keyname
        does not exist, it is automatically added at the end of the
        section.) Example:

            string section[] = "AutoSignature"
            if LoadIniSettings()
                SetIniStr(section, "UserName", "Joe Cool")
                SetIniInt(section, "Signatures", 5)
                SaveIniSettings()
            endif


        SaveIniSettings -----------------------------------------------

        proc SaveIniSettings()

            Changes are automatically saved when you exit TSE or
        when INI.MAC is purged. However, you can also force the
        changes to be saved by calling SaveIniSettings() directly.



        TECHNICALITIES
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

        ù The settings are all stored in a file called TSEPRO.INI in the
          TSE Pro directory, but you don't need to know that; INI takes
          care of it for you.
        ù The TSEPRO.INI file can be edited by hand, too. It is stored
          as a readable text file.
        ù INI was specially written so that two macros that are both in
          use can access their settings without conflicting with each
          other.


        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        Use this macro at your own risk!!
        Enjoy!
