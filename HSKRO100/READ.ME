                          by Howard Kapustein

                              Version 1.0

                                02/22/95

Legal Stuff:

These macros are Copyright (C) 1995 by Howard Kapustein, All Rights
Reserved, but useable as per the usual terms for freeware (you can use
them for yourself w/o paying me, but you can't sell them, etc. and I own
the rights to the macros). If you like them or find any gotchas or
suggestions, send me email or a postcard.

Features:

    - Warning when loading Read-Only files
      TSE Jr. 2.x would beep and display a warning (press ESC to continue)
      and TSE Jr. 3.x would display a message, but TSE simply loads the
      file and keeps going. Very annoying when using version control and
      you don't realize a file's not locked until you can't save the
      file. Particularly annoying if you've made lots of changes to the
      source...

      The read-only indicator is determined at display time.

    - Status Line w/Attributes & Character at Cursor Info
      Easier to see than describe. The status line can display:

        - Short Name
          If the full pathname won't fit on the status line, the path
          can be shortened a la Windows, changing parts of teh path to
          ..., for example C:\SOURCE\PROJECT\HELLO\DEBUG\FOO.CPP might
          be shortened to C:\...\...\HELLO\DEBUG\FOO.CPP.

        - Attributes
          Displays the file's attributes ('R'eadonly, 'Archive', 'S'ystem
          and 'H'idden).

          This macro is pretty smart about tracking file attributes.
          Here's a quick summary:

                * A 'tracking buffer' is created when the macro's
                  loaded. This is used to store attributes for files for
                  display. The 'tracking buffer' is updated at the
                  following times:

                    * When the macro's loaded, it iterates through all
                      windows and updates the info for all files
                      displayed

                    * When a new file is loaded (noticed via
                      _ON_FIRST_EDIT_ hook), the tracking info is
                      updated

                    * When a file is saved (noticed via _ON_FILE_SAVE_
                      hook), the info is updated

                    * When a file is unloaded (noticed via
                      _ON_FILE_QUIT_ hook), the info is updated
                      (removing the info for the unloaded file)

                    * The macro mRefreshFileInfo_Current() (and
                      corresponding menu item) updates the info for the
                      file in the current buffer

                    * The macro mRefreshFileInfo_All() (and
                      corresponding menu item) iterates through all
                      normal buffers and updates the tracking info

                    * After TSE updates the status line (noticed via
                      _AFTER_UPDATE_STATUSLINE_ hook), this macro will
                      display its info (if necessary)

          This effectively caches the attribute info, minimizing disk
          hits. [I didn't want to hit the disk every time the status
          line was updated, much too wasteful and, in some scenarios
          (e.g. floppy or busy network drive), probably unnecessarily
          slow.]

        - Character at Cursor
          This displays the decimal (base-10) and hex (base-16) value of
          the character under the cursor, or "<EOL>" if the cursor is
          past the last character on the line. [TSE Jr. 3.x has this
          feature, and it was easy to do.]

    - Enhanced List Open Files
      Displays a Read-Only indicator in the display.

    - Menus
      Lots of options to configure the display, as well as
      enable/disable the status line macro, view the tracking buffer
      (great for debugging) and other miscellaneous items.

How to use:

Just load and execute READONLY.MAC.

As supplied, all features will be enabled when loaded with the following
keys mapped:

    <CenterCursor>      mHskListOpenFiles()
    <CtrlShift R>       mHskReadOnlyMenu()

NOTE: I had to make it a separate macro because it really needs
      'WhenLoaded' and 'WhenPurged' but TSE.UI already has them and I
      hate directly modifying that file.

Packaging:

Here's what you'll find in this archive:

    READONLY MAC    - Compiled macro
    READONLY MAP    - Map file
    READONLY S      - Source, Main file
    READHLPR S      - Source, Helper functions
    READLIST S      - Source, Enhanced list
    READMENU S      - Source,
    READMSG  S      - Source,
    READSTAT S      - Source, Status Line
    FILE_ID  DIZ    - Description
    READ     ME     - "Documentation" (this file)

To rebuild READONLY.MAC, just run "SC.EXE -M READONLY.S".

NOTE: READHLPR.S contains macros copied from WP.UI and TSE.UI.

NOTE: READHLPR.S will #include "..\UI\WP.BIN". WP.BIN is shipped with
      TSE in the UI directory; I keep my macros in a subdirectory under
      TSE called HSK, hence the relative pathing.

Credit where credit is due:

  * Mike Brocious, for giving me the extra incentive to get up off my
    butt and actually write these macros I'd thought about for a while.

  * Ray Asbury, for posting a wonderful status line macro w/full source,
    greatly improving my education of TSE's hook facility.

  * Richard Blackburn, for spotting the crippling bug that appeared at
    the last minute, due to a simple logic error on my part ("But I
    swear I barely touched the code!" :-)

  * Sage Professional Editor, though I thoroughly dislike it, for its
    nice minor aspects (e.g. read-only indicator in the buffer list),
    even if it's bogged down w/mind-numbing sloth and awkwardness for
    even the most basic operations (the folks at SemWare manage to spoil
    you very quickly...).

If you like these macros, find or bugs or come up with any improvements,
let me know. I'm reguarly on the SemWare BBS as well as CompuServe
(71736,101), or send me a postcard at
