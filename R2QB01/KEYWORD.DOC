'KEYWORD.MAC' is a macro for TSE v1.0 (The Semware Editor) which will
add keywords to recipes which are formatted for import into the QBook
recipe database program. By default, the macro is assigned to the <Alt
Tab> key. You can change this by editing the source file and
recompiling. Place the KEYWORD.MAC and KEYWORD.DAT files in a directory
in your TSEPath. KEYWORD.DAT contains an extensive list of keywords
which you can use. The macro includes a function for adding and deleting
keywords, or you can delete the KEYWORD.DAT file I included, and a very
basic 'default' one will be created. The macro really needs no further
documentation. Load a file of QBook format recipes, and press <Alt Tab>.
Online help is available.

This is my first macro for TSE. If you have any suggestions for
improvements, I can be found lurking about the FidoNet Cooking Echo,
Home Cooking Echo, QBook Echo, or on the TSE support board.
