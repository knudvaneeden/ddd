KEYWS.MAC is a TSE 2.0 macro for adding keywords to recipes formatted for
import into the QBook recipe database program. Because of the similar
structure of QBook's 'Keyword:' and Meal-Master's 'Categories:', this
macro can also be easily modified and recompiled to work with the
Meal-Master recipe database program (though I haven't tested it with
Meal-Master as of yet). All that should be necessary is to change the
first 5 string declarations in the KEYWS.DAT file. Comment out these
lines, and uncomment the 5 lines following:

//variables for Meal-Master format

Below those lines are the following constants... I'm not sure what
Meal-Master uses for these, so they may have to be changed as well:

//constants for QBook format
constant MAX_KEYWLEN = 32           //maximum keyword length
constant MAX_KEYLINE = 78           //maximum length of keyword line



General notes on the "*.KEY" files used by this macro:

Various keywords files can be created by the user (location and filenames
are documented below in the 'KEYWS main menu functions' section). These
files should contain only one keyword per line (each keyword can be more
than word) and the keywords should start in column 1 of the line. The only
file which will be created by the macro (if it doesn't exist) is
"KEYWS.KEY". I also, currently, don't have a function within the macro to
add to these files**. You will have to create/load them and add words as
desired. A sample AUTOSCAN.KEY file is included with this macro.

**Added ability to add words to the KEYWS.KEY file. Pressing F2 from
within the list displayed by the "Add Keywords" function allows adding,
deleting, selecting words from the KEYWS.KEY file list. Changes are
automatically saved.

Special notes on the "KEYWS.KEY" file used by the 'Add Keywords' and
the "AUTOSCAN.KEY" file used by the 'AutoScan' functions:

I'm still working on the best way to do searches for matching words in the
recipe which will find the most "valid" matches, without erroneously
matching undesired words. I wanted to be able to, for example, search for
'Raspberry' and match either 'Raspberry' or 'Raspberries'. To do this, the
search procedure drops the last letter of the keyword (but only if the
keyword is longer than 4 characters, to avoid some errors). I found that I
was still getting too many mismatches, so I added a check for a "~" ***
character at the end of the keywords contained in the KEYWS.KEY file. This
makes it possible to put a "~" character at the end of a word which will
force an exact match, as the "~" is dropped instead of the last letter of
the keyword. The check for the "~" ensures that it will also be dropped
from the short (<5 char) keywords. The search in 'Add Keywords' is done in
such a way that the keyword must match the found text only at the
beginning of the word (ie: a search for 'berry' will not match
'raspberry'. This, again, was done to avoid excessive mismatches. These
methods work fairly well, but I'm still working on them.

The 'AutoScan' function allows you to choose whether the search should be
"whole word" or not. Since it automatically adds keywords to all recipes
in the file, you may wish to be "safe" and select the ***whole word match.
The manual 'Add Keywords' function does not use a whole word match.

*** The "~" character can be used in the AUTOSCAN.KEY file, as well. This
will force a "whole word match" even if whole word match is not selected.


Other keywords files (not documented below):
COUNTRY.KEY - must be located in the same directory as KEYWS.MAC
    List of country names which can be added as keywords
MAINCAT.KEY - must be located in the same directory as KEYWS.MAC
    List of main categories which can be added as keywords
I'm still working on the functions which use these files, so for now see
the help screen available from the 'Add Keywords' function for
documentation. You can put anything you want for keywords in these files.
They are not used in any search functions (as of yet, at least). Two
small sample files are included with the macro.



KEYWS main menu functions:

NOTE: the 'Add Keywords', 'AutoScan', and 'Global Add' functions all
perform checks for duplicate keywords so that no dupes will be added. All
searches are case insensitive.

'Add Keywords' menu function:

This function creates a popup list of keywords for the recipe. The list
includes the following:

1. keywords from the original recipe
2. words from the KEYWS.KEY file which match words in the recipe.

Help for functions available while viewing the list is available by
pressing F1 while the list is displayed.

The KEYWS.KEY file must be located in the same directory as this macro. If
it doesn't exist, a small file will be created.


'Go to next recipe' menu function:
This function merely advances the screen display to the next recipe
contained in the file being edited.


'Autoscan' menu function:

This function automatically adds keywords to each recipe in the file which
is loaded. You will be prompted whether to match 'whole words' or not. If
you respond 'No', more matches will probably be found. For example, if you
have 'Game hen' in your AUTOSCAN.KEY file and you say 'No' to the match
whole words prompt, 'Game hens' will be found as a match, whereas it would
not match if you chose whole word matches only.

The following files (if they exist) are used to provide the keywords for
AutoScan:

In the same directory as this macro:
1. AUTOSCAN.KEY - list of words to search for in the recipe. If a match
   is found, the word will be added as a keyword.
2. ALLREC.KEY - list of words to add to ALL recipes in any file that
   AutoScan is run on. This could be used, for example, by a BBS sysop to
   add their BBS name, as a keyword, to all recipes.

In the current directory:
1. ALLDIR.KEY - list of words to add to ALL recipes in all files in the
   current directory.
2. (filename).KEY - where '(filename)' is the name of the recipe file
   being edited. These words will be added only to recipes in a file if
   the filenames match. For example, if you are editing a file named
   'SWEDISH.QBF', any words found in a file named 'SWEDISH.KEY' will be
   added as keywords.


'Global Delete' menu function:

This function will prompt you for a keyword to delete from ALL recipes in
the file being edited. The search for keywords to delete is not case
sensitive, but the word must otherwise match exactly or it will not be
deleted.


'Global Change' menu function:

This function will prompt you for a keyword to change, and for the word to
replace it with. I tried to be sure that only exact matches would be
changed. For example, if you want to change all occurrances of the keyword
'main' to 'Main dish', other keywords containing the word 'main' (as 'Main
course') will not be changed. The search is not case sensitive, however.

Addendum:
I've tried to ensure that duplicate keywords will not be added to recipes.
However, if the recipe already contains duplicate words, they will not be
deleted.
