/*

(06-21-2004) Ansi2oem for GUI versions of TSE Pro. In editing text it
can show ANSI characters as OEM, and line drawing characters in 3D. It
can do this  very configurably. With ANSI fonts get rid of those
control characters all looking like squares, and get line drawing(s)
back! At the same time it serves as an ascii chart which correctly
shows each character's look. Version 3 remembers the last character and
has minute improvements to the help text. Author:
