     1   INTRODUCTION

     FSORT reads data from an input file, sorts it, and writes it to an
     output file.  Sorting rearranges the lines of the file so that the keys
     of the lines are in a specified order.  FSORT is similar to the MS-DOS
     sort command and provides the following benefits:

         o   FSORT is faster than other sort programs, and MUCH faster than
             the MS-DOS sort command.

         o   FSORT sorts any size file.

         o   FSORT is careful in it's use of disk space, so that files can be
             sorted successfully even when there's little space available.

         o   FSORT can handle any number of sort keys, sort in ascending or
             descending order, and ignore the case (upper/lower) of letters.

         o   FSORT can sort using character or numeric keys.

         o   FSORT can remove duplicate lines.


     FSORT runs on any IBM-compatible computer using MS-DOS 3.00 or later,
     and uses whatever memory is available.  At least 150K is needed, but
     more results in faster sorting.  The file to be sorted must be stored in
     the MS-DOS text file format, and may reside on floppy diskettes, hard
     disks, RAM disks, or network drives.

     If you want to try out FSORT right now, just run FSORT with no command
     line arguments.  FSORT will display a brief description of its operation
     that you can use to get started.



     2   OPERATION

     You control FSORT with command line arguments that specify the input
     file, output file, and sorting options.  The arguments may be specified
     in any order.  FSORT is invoked like this:

         fsort  [options]  [<] infile  [>] outfile

     The options are:

         OPTION  EFFECT

         /+n     Sort in ascending order using the key starting at column n

         /-n     like /+n, only sort in descending order

         /+n:m   like /+n, only the key length is m

         /+Nn    like /+n, only treat key as a decimal number


                                       - 1 -


         /C      ignore differences between upper and lower case letters

         /U      discard lines that have duplicate keys

         /T      trace sort operations


     These sort key forms can be combined, e.g. /-N5:6 can be used to sort a
     fixed length numeric key.  For more details, see the Operational Details
     section below.

     The first file name identifies the input file that contains the lines to
     be sorted.  The second file name identifies the output file, which will
     contain the contents of the input file reordered by FSORT.  File names
     can include names with or without paths in the standard MS-DOS format,
     but wild-card characters ("*" and "?") aren't permitted.  The MS-DOS
     input redirection operator ("<") may be used for the input file, and the
     output redirection operator (">") may be used for the output file.  The
     pipe operator ("|") may also be used for either input or output.  If no
     output file is specified, the output is displayed on the screen.

     The /U option removes lines that have duplicate keys from the output
     file.  The keys must be exactly the same to be removed (unless the /C,
     /+N, or /-N option is specified); e.g. if one key has a trailing space
     at the end and another doesn't, neither line will be removed.  Lines
     that have no key (i.e. a 10-character line with a key starting in column
     20) are also removed.

     The /C option makes FSORT ignore case (i.e. upper case vs. lower case
     letters) when comparing keys.  This affects both the sort order and the
     removal of lines with duplicate keys.

     The /T option makes FSORT display status information as it sorts.  You
     can use this option to help understand how FSORT works, or to determine
     what's happening when an error occurs.

     FSORT sometimes creates temporary work files while it's working, and
     then deletes them when it's finished.  FSORT examines the FSTEMP
     environment variable to determine the drive and directory to use for
     these files.  You can specify multiple locations by separating each path
     with a semicolon.  E.g. to direct FSORT to use the TEMP directory of the
     E: drive, and then (if more space is needed) the root directory on the
     D: drive, enter the command:

             set FSTEMP=E:\TEMP;D:\

     before running FSORT.  If FSORT can't create and read a file in a
     directory specified in the environment variable, it will terminate when
     it tries to use that directory.  If FSORT doesn't find FSTEMP, it looks
     for the TEMP or TMP variables.  If these aren't found (or if the disks
     specified don't have enough space), FSORT uses the root directory of the
     hard or network disks on your system as needed.  Note that it's not
     necessary to specify these environment variables, but it's useful when
     you want FSORT to use the fastest drive available.

     If you want to interrupt FSORT at any time press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break.
     Any work files and partially written output files will be deleted.





                                      - 2 -


     Sorting large files can be time consuming.  You can maximize the sort
     speed by doing the following:

         o   Specify a RAM disk for your temporary work files.  If you can't
             use a RAM disk, use the fastest disk available.

         o   Run FSORT with plenty of memory.  The more memory available, the
             faster FSORT runs.  Providing more memory reduces or even
             eliminates the need for work files, and consequently speeds up
             the sort.

         o   If you're sorting large files, run FSORT with plenty of file
             handles.  (The number of file handles controls the number of
             files that can be open at one time.)  You can increase the total
             number of file handles by increasing the value specified in the
             FILES statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  You can prevent other
             programs from taking file handles by running FSORT with no other
             programs (e.g. MS Windows or a TSR that access files) active at
             the same time.

         o   Avoid numeric keys when you can.  Numeric keys take more time to
             process.

         o   Use as few keys as possible.  The more keys you specify, the
             slower the sort.

         o   Don't use the /C option unless you really need it, because it
             makes FSORT run more slowly.


     You may find that FSORT is unable to sort a file because of insufficient
     disk space.  If you specify the same file name for both the input and
     output file, FSORT will write the output file over the input file.  This
     lets you sort files that otherwise would be too large to process, but it
     does incur the risk of loosing your file.  FSORT will not delete the
     input file until it has fully read it, so if it then finishes
     successfully, you will have no problem.  But if something goes wrong,
     you could loose your file!  I've done what I can to ensure that this
     won't occur, but there are no guarantees.  The choice is yours.

     By the way, don't ever specify the same input and output file names when
     using redirection (i.e. the "<" and ">" operators).  If you do, MS-DOS
     will destroy your file (unless it's very short) before FSORT can read
     it!

     Here are some examples of FSORT use:

                   fsort  test.in  test.out

         The contents of file test.in is sorted and written to file test.out.
         The file is sorted in ascending order, using the whole line as the
         sort key.


                   fsort  /+5  <a:\mp\data.in  >a:\wp\data.out

         The contents of file a:\mp\test.in is sorted and written to file
         a:\wp\test.out.  The file is sorted in ascending order, using the
         key starting in the 5th character of each line.



                                      - 3 -


                   dir | fsort  /+N13:10

         The output from the MS-DOS dir command is sorted on the file length
         field and displayed on the screen.


                   fsort  /-5  /+N10:5  /c  <data.in  data.out

         The contents of file data.in is sorted and written to file data.out.
         The file is sorted in descending order on the key in columns 5 thru
         9 and in ascending order on the numeric key in columns 10 thru 14.
         The case of letters is ignored when comparing keys.


                   fsort  /c  /u  data  data

         The input file is sorted and re-written back to the same file.  Any
         duplicate records are discarded.  The case of letters is ignored
         when comparing keys and testing for duplicates.



     3   OPERATIONAL DETAILS

     When you specify a key without a length (e.g. "/+5"), FSORT sorts the
     file using the key starting at the specified column and extending to the
     end of the line, or the beginning of another key, which ever comes
     first.  When you specify a length explicitly (e.g. "/+5:10"), FSORT
     looks only at the key characters specified.  There's no problem if you
     specify a key that extends past the end of a line; FSORT treats the
     missing characters as if they are less than characters that are present
     in a longer line.

     When you specify a numeric key (with the "N" option), FSORT interprets
     the digits "1" through "9", an optional leading sign ("+" or "-"), and
     an optional decimal point (".") as a number, and then sorts using the
     number.  FSORT ignores any leading spaces or tabs, and stops when it
     finds a character that can't be part of a number.  FSORT also accepts
     numbers in scientific notation, e.g. 5.9E-5 (which is equivalent to
     0.000059).

     When you specify more than one key specification (e.g. "/+20 /+5:8"),
     FSORT uses the first specification (the "/+20") to determine the order.
     If the keys are equal, FSORT then looks at the second (i.e. "/+5:8")
     specification, and continues looking at additional specifications until
     unequal keys are found or all specifications are checked.

     If FSORT finds two lines with equal keys, it keeps their original order
     in the sorted file.

     Keys are compared in ASCII order.  Control characters (e.g. tabs) aren't
     expanded before comparing, so you should be careful when comparing lines
     containing these characters.

     FSORT has been successfully tested on three networks: Novell's Netware
     and Netware Lite, and Digital Equipment Corporation's Pathworks.  The
     only problem occurs with Pathworks: files with some VMS Record Formats,
     e.g. Variable, cannot be sorted.  The Stream Record Format works fine.

     FSORT assumes that the resources it uses (i.e. disk space, file handles,
     and memory) don't vary while it runs.  If you run another program (e.g.

                                      - 4 -


     a TSR) that consumes any of these resources while FSORT is running,
     FSORT may malfunction.

     6   ERROR MESSAGES

     FSORT displays an error message whenever it's invoked with arguments
     that it can't process, or when problems occur that prevent it from
     performing the requested work.  This section lists all the messages that
     FSORT displays, as well as a description of what each message means and
     what to do to correct the problem.  If you have any problems that you
     can't correct, please contact FSORT support as described in section 4.

         FSORT error: column of key "<key>" is to big; limit is <n>.
             FSORT only sorts lines up to <n> characters long, so you can't
             specify a key that starts after that.





                                      - 6 -


         FSORT error: couldn't create work file <fn>; <reason>.
         FSORT error: couldn't create output file <fn>; <reason>.
             FSORT was unable to create the work file <fn> or final output
             file because of the problem stated in <reason>.  You can
             probably guess what the problem is by looking at the location of
             the file specified in <fn> and the problem description.  This
             usually occurs because the work file location specified in the
             FSTEMP, TEMP, or TMP MS-DOS environment variable is incorrect.
             You can examine these variables by typing "set" at the MS-DOS
             prompt.  Whichever variable you have should specify one or more
             paths where work files can be placed.  This message also occurs
             when the work file is on a network drive, and you don't have the
             necessary rights to create a file in that directory and drive.

         FSORT error: couldn't open input file; <reason>.
             FSORT couldn't the input file you specified on the command line
             because of the problem stated in <reason>.  You can usually
             figure out what's wrong by examining the problem description.
             The most likely problem is that the input file name is specified
             incorrectly.

         FSORT error: couldn't open enough files concurrently.
             FSORT couldn't open enough files at once to perform the sort.
             Since FSORT can sort with only three files open at once (even
             though it's not very efficient), this message usually indicates
             that you've done something to lower the number.  If you have
             other programs running (e.g. TSRs, MS-Windows) that keep files
             open, unload them.  You can also alter the FILES statement in
             your config.sys file to increase the number.

         FSORT error: couldn't allocate memory for I/O buffer.
         FSORT error: couldn't allocate memory for input buffer.
         FSORT error: couldn't allocate memory for line buffer.
         FSORT error: couldn't allocate memory for output buffer.
         FSORT error: couldn't allocate memory for priority queue.
             FSORT ran out of memory when trying to sort.  FSORT needs about
             150K to sort at all, and more to sort large files efficiently.
             If you run FSORT from the MS-DOS window of another program, try
             unloading the program and then running FSORT directly from the
             MS-DOS prompt.  If you load TSRs that use large amounts of
             memory, try removing them.

         FSORT error: error closing file <fn>; <reason>.
         FSORT error: error reading file <fn>; <reason>.
         FSORT error: error writing file <fn>; <reason>.

             FSORT was unable to close, read, or write file <fn> because of
             <reason>.  This error is usually caused by an unrecoverable I/O
             error as described in <reason>.  The problem causing the error
             must be corrected.

         FSORT error: insufficient disk space for output file.
             There isn't enough space on your disk for the output file.  You
             can correct this problem by deleting unneeded files on the
             output drive, or specifying a different output drive that has
             more space.  In some cases FSORT must put work files on the same
             drive as the output file; when this occurs, freeing space on
             other drives will also help.  You may also have lost some
             sectors on your disk; these can be recovered by running the MS-
             DOS program "chkdsk" with the "/f" option.  As a last resort, if
             you don't need the unsorted file, you can specify the same file

                                      - 7 -


             name for both input and output so that FSORT will overwrite the
             input file.  But be aware that you run the risk of loosing your
             data if something goes wrong.

         FSORT error: insufficient disk space for work file.
             There isn't enough space on your disk for the needed work files.
             You can correct this problem by deleting unneeded files on any
             of your hard drives.  You may also have lost some clusters on
             your disk; these can be recovered by running the MS-DOS program
             "chkdsk" with the "/f" option.  If you don't need the input file
             after the sort, you can specify the same file name for both
             input and output so that FSORT will overwrite the input file.
             But be aware that you run the risk of loosing your data if
             something goes wrong.

         FSORT error: key "<key>" exceeds limit of <n> keys.
             FSORT only allows sorting with up to <n> keys.  The <key> key
             exceeds that limit.

         FSORT error: key "<key>" extends into column <n>; limit is <m>.
             FSORT only sorts lines up to <m> characters long, so you can't
             specify a sort key that extends beyond that.  Your key <key>
             extends to column <n>.

         FSORT error: key "<key>" has a starting column less than 1.
             FSORT numbers the columns (i.e. characters) in each line
             starting at 1, so each sort key starting value must be 1 or
             more.  The <key> sort key has a value of zero.

         FSORT error: key "<key>" has a length less than 1.
             Sort keys must be one or more characters long; you specified a
             length of zero.

         FSORT error: key "<key>" is malformed.
             Each sort key argument must have the form "/+n", "/-n", "/+n:m",
             "/-n:m", "/+Nn", "/-Nn", "/+Nn:m", or "/-Nn:m" where n and m are
             positive decimal numbers.  The key you specified isn't in this
             form.  Examples of correct keys are "/+5", "/-8:3", "/+3:8".
             Note that the double quote character isn't coded on the command
             line; e.g. a sample use of FSORT is:
                 fsort  /+5:5  /-10  infile  outfile

         FSORT error: keys "<key1>" and "<key2>" start in the same column.
         FSORT error: keys "<key1>" and "<key1>" overlap in column <n>.
             It doesn't make sense for sort keys to overlap, because FSORT
             doesn't know how to sort the overlapping part.  You specified
             two sort keys (<key1> and <key2>) that overlap in column <n>.

         FSORT error: line <n> is too long to sort; limit is <m>.
             FSORT can only sort lines up to <m> characters long.  Line
             number <n> exceeds that limit.

         FSORT error: no input file specified.
             FSORT didn't find the name of a file to sort on the command
             line.  You must specify the name of the file to be sorted.

         FSORT error: too many work files; limit is <n>.
             FSORT needed to create more than <n> work files to sort your
             file.  This occurs either because you have an extremely large
             file to sort, or you have run FSORT with very little memory
             available.  FSORT needs about 200K to sort at all, and more to

                                      - 8 -


             sort large files efficiently.  If you run FSORT from the MS-DOS
             window of another program, try unloading the program and then
             running FSORT directly from the MS-DOS prompt.  If you load TSRs
             that use large amounts of memory, try removing them.

         FSORT error: unable to get status of file.
             FSORT was unable to obtain status information from MS-DOS about
             a work file.  This error should not occur in normal operation.
             If it does, please contact FSORT support as described in
             section 4.

         FSORT error: unknown argument "<arg>".
             FSORT couldn't recognize <arg> as either a file name or a valid
             option.  Check the list of arguments that FSORT accepts to
             determine what arguments you can use.  You can list the options
             FSORT recognizes by typing "fsort ?".  Remember that each option
             must start with a "/", e.g. "/C".  You may also have specified
             too many file names.  You may specify either one input file, or
             one input file and one output file.  Note that if you forget to
             enter a "/" before an option, FSORT will interpret it as a file
             name.

         FSORT error: unrecoverable I/O problem.
             FSORT encountered a I/O error that could not be corrected.  This
             is generally caused by a damaged disk.  You must correct the
             problem causing the error before proceeding.

         FSORT error: user aborted program.
             This message is displayed when you abort FSORT with Ctrl-C or
             Ctrl-Break.
