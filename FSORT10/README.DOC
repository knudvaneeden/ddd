     2  Program descriptions:

        Program: Cipher

        Version: 1.5

        Files:   CIPHER.COM     Program
                 CIPHER.DOC     Documentation

        Purpose:

           Cipher scrambles files so that no one can use them - unless they
           have the correct key.  Cipher is designed to protect files on your
           computer from misuse by others who may have access to your PC.
           (The ZEROFREE program described below is also useful for this.)
           Cipher provides the following benefits:

        Features:

           o  Cipher is easy to use - it protects you from mistakes and helps
              you to remember keys.

           o  Cipher is much faster than other programs that provide
              comparable security.


                                       - 1 -

           o  Protection is provided by a reliable, documented method that is
              highly resistant to attack - even by expert programmers and
              cryptographic analysts.

           o  Cipher can encrypt files in place, so unerase utilities can't
              recreate them.

           o  Cipher can also make a new encrypted file and leave the
              original file untouched - this is useful when sending an
              encrypted file to someone else.

           o  Cipher checks when decrypting a file to ensure that the file
              hasn't been corrupted.

           o  Cipher can be used from batch files to provide security
              automatically.

           o  Cipher guards against changes to itself - you can be sure you
              have an unmodified Cipher and also detect any subsequent
              tampering.



        Program: FC

        Version: 2.7

        Files:   FC.EXE         Program
                 FC.DOC         Documentation

        Purpose:

           FC compares two text files and lists the differences between them
           line by line.  FC provides the following benefits:

        Features:

           o  FC shows word by word differences between lines that have
              changed.

           o  FC can ignore white space changes.  This is useful when you
              want to ignore format changes in "C" programs or other text.

           o  FC never gets confused or "unsynchronized" (as some comparison
              programs can).

           o  FC always finds the smallest set of differences between files,
              and never misses matching lines.

           o  FC helps "C" programmers merge program changes.  FC can compare
              two "C" programs containing separate sets of changes, and
              combine them automatically to make a single program.

           o  FC lets you do multiple comparisons in one run.

           o  FC lets you list changes in ways that make sense to you by
              providing multiple display options.  You can also customize FC
              to use your favorite options automatically.

        Program: FCDOC

        Version: 2.4

        Files:   FC.EXE         Program
                 FC.DOC         Documentation

        Purpose:

           FCDOC compares two text English files and lists the differences
           between them sentence by sentence.  FCDOC works with any ASCII
           text file containing English text.

        Features:

           o  FCDOC ignores format differences, so changes in margins,
              indentation, and white space are not shown.  This allows you to
              look at content changes without being distracted by unimportant
              details.

           o  FCDOC can show word by word differences between sentences that
              have changed.

           o  FCDOC never gets confused or "unsynchronized" (as some
              comparison programs can).

           o  FCDOC always finds the smallest set of differences between
              files, and never misses matching sentences.

           o  FCDOC lets you do multiple comparisons in one run.

           o  FCDOC lets you list changes in ways that make sense to you by
              providing multiple display options.  You can also customize
              FCDOC to use your favorite options automatically.



        Program: FCBIN

        Version: 1.2

        Files:   FCBIN.EXE      Program
                 FCBIN.DOC      Documentation

        Purpose:

           FCBIN compares two files and lists the differences between them
           byte by byte.

        Features:

           o  FCBIN shows PER BYTE differences between files.  Line endings
              are treated just like other characters.

           o  Any type of file - ASCII, executable, data base, etc. - can be
              compared.

           o  FCBIN never gets confused or "unsynchronized" (as some
              comparison programs can).




                                      - 3 -

           o  FCBIN always finds the smallest set of differences between
              files, and never misses matching bytes.

           o  FCBIN lets you do multiple comparisons in one run.

           o  FCBIN can be customized to use your favorite options
              automatically.



        Program: ZEROFREE

        Version: 1.0

        Files:   ZEROFREE.EXE      Program
                 ZEROFREE.DOC      Documentation

        Purpose:

           ZEROFREE protects your deleted files from access by others who
           have access to your machine.  Without ZEROFREE, undelete utilities
           and disk editors can recover data that is left in unused data
           areas of your disk.

        Features:

           o  ZEROFREE zeroes the complete unallocated data area of a disk,
              so undelete utilities, disk editors, and data recovery programs
              cannot access data from deleted files.

           o  ZEROFREE zeroes the directory entries of deleted files, so that
              the names, sizes, or dates of deleted files are erased too.

           o  ZEROFREE zeroes the unused space at the end of files, so that
              disk editors can't recover data that may remain there.


        Program: FSORT

        Version: 1.0

        Files:   FSORT.EXE      Program
                 FSORT.DOC      Documentation

        Purpose:

           FSORT reads data from an input file, sorts it, and writes it to an
           output file.

        Features:

        o  FSORT is faster than other sort programs, and MUCH faster than the
           MS-DOS sort command.

        o  FSORT sorts any size file.

        o  FSORT is careful in it's use of disk space, so that files can be
           sorted successfully even when there's little space available.

        o  FSORT can handle any number of sort keys, sort in ascending or
           descending order, and ignore the case (upper/lower) of letters.


                                      - 4 -

        o  FSORT can sort using character or numeric keys.

        o  FSORT can remove duplicate lines.



        Program: ZIPFIND

        Version: 1.2

        Files:   ZIPFIND.EXE    Program
                 ZIPFIND.DOC    Documentation

        Purpose:

           ZIPFIND searches ZIP or ARC files for text strings, and displays
           each line of each archived file that contains the desired string.

        Features:

           o  Any type of file stored in an ARC or ZIP file can be searched
              for any text string.

           o  You can use your own text search program to provide more
              powerful search options.  Many programs (e.g. GREP variants)
              provide pattern searches and special output options not
              otherwise available.

           o  You can use MS-DOS wildcards to search multiple ARC and ZIP
              files.



        Program: D

        Version: 1.1

        Files:   D.EXE          Program
                 D.DOC          Documentation

        Purpose:

              D lets you manipulate directories, files, and archives in an
              intuitive and direct way.

        Features:

           o  D provides all standard file operations (e.g. view, delete,
              copy) plus more obscure operations (e.g. setting file date).

           o  D provides all standard directory operations (e.g. make
              directory) plus more obscure operations (e.g. delete a
              directory and all files within it).

           o  D handles ARC and ZIP files as if they were directories.

           o  D provides many other features.






                                      - 5 -

        Program: ASCIIZE

        Version: 1.2

        Files:   ASCIIZE.EXE    Program

        Purpose:

           ASCIIZE transforms any file to or from an ASCII-encoded form.
           This is useful when transferring a binary file via an ASCII-only
           medium (e.g. an EMAIL message).

        Features:

           o  You can add an explanation to the front of the ASCII-encoded
              file.

           o  Any changes made to the ASCII-encoded text are detected when
              the text is converted back to binary.



        Program: SQUISH

        Version: 1.0

        Files:   SQUISH.EXE     Program

        Purpose:

           SQUISH compresses or decompresses files.

        Features:

           o  Squish uses standard input and output, so that file redirection
              and pipes can be used.



     3  Support, Ordering, and Licensing:

        I support all programs via CompuServe mail.  Messages should
        carefully describe your problem or question, and be sure to note the
        version of the program you're using.  I support all registered users,
        and usually reply to those who haven't yet decided whether or not to

        All my programs are distributed as shareware.  Registration payments
        are donated to Oxfam America, an international development and
        disaster relief agency.  It's a worthy charity that I've been
        supporting for many years.  As stated in Oxfam literature,

           "Oxfam America is an international agency that funds self-help
           development projects and disaster relief in poor countries in
           Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and also prepares and distributes
           educational materials for people in the United States on the
           issues of development and hunger.  The name "Oxfam" comes from the
           Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, founded in England in 1942.
           Oxfam America, based in Boston, was formed in 1970, and is one of
           seven autonomous Oxfams around the world (Great Britain,
           Australia, Belgium, Canada, Quebec, Hong Kong and the United
           States).  Oxfam is a nonsectarian, nonprofit agency that neither
           seeks or accepts U.S. government funds.  All contributions are
           tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law."


        For more information, you can phone Oxfam at 617-482-1211, or write
        to them at:
