 I spotted the following tip from Semware BBS file TSE_TIP4

 Sounded great and I promptly added it to my UI file and 'burned it in'.
 But I quickly found I couldn't stand the incessant beeping every time
 I hit the Top or Bottom (or Left Margin which I also added), ESPECIALLY
 SINCE I COULD NOT DISABLE IT NOW I HAD BURNED IT INTO MY EDITOR!!!!
 So I propose the following:  Compile this source file as an external
 macro and load it whenever you want to be 'Alarming' !!  You can even
 insert it in your 'Potpourri' if you like.
 Now whenever you tire of your new 'Alarming' capabilities, you can
 simply Purge the macro.  (Simple)

Apologies & Credits: to GEORGE DE BRUIN, of course!

NOTE:  For a related macro of (mine?) which allows keyboard macros to
       'break out' if they encounter the same kinds of situations,
       see my BREAK.S .  (Again with apologies to someone at SemWare
       but I've forgotten who! <sheepish>
