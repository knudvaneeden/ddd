Overview: Check current file being edited against most recently saved
          version on disk. (ie the 'Original')
          Really just a small (but handy!) variation on the EXCELLENT
          CMP2BKUP file comparison utility by IAN CAMPBELL

Word of Explanation:

Sometimes when I am about to exit or quit from a file Ive been editing, and
I'm being asked "Save Changes? ", I feel like answering (tongue-in-cheek)
"Well I'm not sure.  Let me see the changes first!!!"  This little macro
allows you to do exactly that!  It first changes the Current File Name to
the same 'root' name with extension ".xyz".  Then it calls TSE's excellent
CMP2BKUP macro and when the user presses the Down Arrow at the prompt for
BackUp Filename, the original filename is automatically presented.  (This
assumes that the current file actually does exist on disk.  If it didn't,
there would be no point in calling CMP2BKUP, would there?!)

Once in CMP2BKUP, you can get extra help on how to hi-lite differences by
pressing F1. Finally, when you escape from CMP2BKUP, you are prompted as to
whether you want to change the "xyz" file back to it's original name.

If you decide you DO want to save the file and update the file on disk,
answer 'Yes' and then Save, Quit or Exit, answering (without hesitation
now!) a definite 'Yes' to the familiar "Save Changes? " prompt.

If you decide you don't want to overwrite the file on disk, you can keep the
"xyz" name and save with that name, and/or continue editing or simply
discard the new version you've worked so hard on (and apparently 'screwed
up'!) by choosing quit or exit and answering "No" to "Save Changes? ".
