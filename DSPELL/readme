DSPELL - An Alternative Spelling Checker Interface for TSE by
Dave Monksfield. Comments or suggestions to: drm@myob.demon.co.uk

INTRODUCTION

    A while ago I got fed up with the way spell-checkers worked,
    sequentially stepping through the 'errors' most of which are OK
    (names or jargon or whatever).  So I put together an alternative
    interface to the TSE spelling engine.

    It scans the whole document (or selection, if there is one) then
    pops up a scrolling window of all suspect words.  As you scroll up
    and down it, the corresponding word is highlighted in the main
    document window.  This makes it very easy top ignore the 95% bogus
    errors and concentrate on the genuine mistakes.  When you ask to
    correct a word, you get a text box with the 'suggestions' in its
    history so they can be accessed with up/down-arrow.

STATUS

    This release of DSPELL (revision 0.12.0.1) is decidedly beta-ish.
    It has only been tested by me on one TSE configuration.  It is not
    fully complete or documented (few comments and no online help) but
    is reasonably tidy and robust.

INSTALLATION

    You should have received the following files:

    DSPELL.S    -- the SAL macro source file for DSPELL
    README      -- this file
    COPYING     -- the GPL copying, copyright and warranty rules

    To install DSPELL:
    1.  Copy DSPELL.S to the MAC subdirectory of your TSE installation
    2.  Open it in TSE
    3.  Compile it using <Ctrl-F9> or by selecting "Compile" from
        the "Macro" menu
    4.  Add the resulting DSPELL.MAC to your autoload list
        (using "Autoload List" on the "Macro" menu) if you wish.

USAGE

    Press F8. If text is selected DSPELL will just check that, otherwise
    it will check the whole file.  If DSPELL finds any potentially
    misspelt words, a wordlist window will appear at the right of the
    screen, in which the following commands may be used.

    <CursorUp>, <CursorDown>, <PgUp>, <PgDn>, <Home> and <End> move
    around the wordlist.

    If there is more than one occurrence of the selected word in the
    document, <n> or <CursorRight> highlights the next occurrence, <p>
    or <CursorLeft> highlights the previous occurrence and <1> or <f>
    highlights the first occurrence in the document window.

    If the current word looks OK, <d> or <Del> will remove it from the
    list.  This has no purpose other than to tidy up the wordlist.

    To change spelling of the current word, press <c>.  An editable text
    box pops up showing the current spelling.  At this point the
    spelling can be manually corrected, or <CursorUp> can be used to pop
    up a list of suggestions.  Press <Enter> to apply the change.  The
    change will be applied to *all* occurrences of the word in the
    document (or selection).

    If the word or document needs to be edited directly, use <Enter> or
    <tab> to switch from the wordlist to the document window.  <tab> or
    <F8> in the document will switch back to the wordlist.

    To terminate DSPELL, press <Escape> from the wordlist.  This will
    remove the wordlist window and return to the document window.

CUSTOMIZATION

    The invocation key (F8) and the word-window commands can easily be
    changed by modifying DSPELL.S and recompiling.  I'll leave the
    details as an exercise for the reader.

SUGGESTIONS

    I would welcome any suggestions for improvements or reports of
    specific bugs, particularly if accompanied by the necessary code
    patches!  Please bear in mind that DSPELL was never intended to be
    all-singing, all-dancing.  For example I have intentionally omitted
    custom dictionaries - the way DSPELL works means you can easily
    ignore specific words anyway.

BUGS

    I'm sure there are some, though I've been using DSPELL for some
    months with no problems.

    The most likely failing is that my code depends on something in my
    specific TSE configuration.  This is a difficult one to test, I'll
    just have to rely on the bug reports.

COPYING

stuff is longer than the macro . . . it seemed to safer to attach the
GPL rather than trying to make up my own legal statement)
