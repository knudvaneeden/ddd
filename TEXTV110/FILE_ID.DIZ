TextView is a full-text search and retrieval
tool for text files which contain a repeated
discernible   structure.   The  macro  takes
advantage of  TSE  large  file  and  virtual
memory capability to allow rapid access to a
user  definable  set  of   text   resources.
Examples  of  common text resources include:
Ralf Brown's DOS Interrupt List; Tom Klein's
TSE  Tip  files;  various  *.DOC files;  BBS
'Allfiles' listings, source libraries,  etc.
Version 1.10 adds support for untagged file
collections (like source/macro files).
