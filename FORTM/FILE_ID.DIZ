Collection of macros to clean up FORTRAN
code, i.e. Indent correctly, relabel, find
redundant subroutines, labels etc.  Macros
were written for Semware Editor Professional
v2.50. Based on FORTRAN 77, as used on Unisys
1100/2200 hardware. Source code given so
could be adapted for other versions of
FORTRAN and other hardware.
