                      Log of changes made to interface

*****************************************************************************

10/1/94     Tested with Production/Final Release v.2.0.  Finally gave up
            on underlining -- you'll have to plug in an underliner
            yourself in the F8 key.  (See WP4PROG.DOC under F8)

6/7/94      Adjusted for Beta version 1.52B. Many changes to routine and
            variable names; the CONVERT.S macro provided by Semware did
            most of the work.  Thanks, guys!

3/31/94     Adjusted for Beta version 1.51O. Played with colors a lot
            lately, with help from many beta testers, and have settled
            on a slight variation of Phyllis Holt's color scheme. Thanks,
            Phyllis!

1/15/94     Adjusted for Beta version 1.51A. Implemented Semware spell
            checking package from beta TSE.

12/19/93    Adjusted for Beta version 1.01G; rearranged some Ctrl-<letter>
            keys to get more in; added paragraph wrapping package.

11/28/93    Updated to Beta veraion 1.01a; implemented Compile.Mac package.

10/23/93    Finished changes and adjustments for Beta level 1.00Z; added
            Clock(); moved some F10 and F12 keys to make more logical and
            accomodate Function List; updated .Hlp and .Doc files

10/17/93    Modified for Beta level 1.00U version; added PCTags.S and
            FPCalc.S; changed main menu line

10/93       Added enhanced Match.S package

5/1/93      Fixed error in documentation stating Shift F2 was Backward
            Search, when in reality RepeatFind was assigned to Shft-F2.
            Backward searches can be specified easily with plain F2 by
            specifying the B option at the Search Options prompt. (Also
            more user-friendly to those who used TSE Jr.'s WP emulator;
            Randy had Shft-F2 as RepeatFind there.)

4/22/93     First release of WordPerfect for Programmers User Interface
            for TSE; pre-release version 0.93.
