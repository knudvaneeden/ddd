Installing the WP4PROG Interface

1) First, you need to have a copy of Tessie installed on your machine. I
will assume you did the default installation, which created a directory
called UI underneath the main TSE subdirectory. This is where the standard
Tessie User Interface files are located.

2) Make a directory under your TSE directory named WP4 or something like
that, and change to this directory. This is where the WP4PROG files will go,
and where you will doctor Tessie by "burning in" this new User Interface.
(So you should have a path something like C:\TSE\WP4 )

3) Copy the SC.EXE and E.EXE files from the TSE subdirectory to the WP4
directory you should be in. You don't want to change your current copy
of E.EXE, the main editor, in case you don't like this interface!

4) Unzip or copy the files listed above (wp4prog.*) into this WP4
subdirectory.

5) Give the following command to install the interface:

                        sc -b wp4prog

You should see a message followed by a lot of dots, then the message
"Burning configuration into e.exe".

6) That's it! You're done. To run the editor, just give the command

                        e

Most of the keys are WP-standard, although there are some important
exceptions and many, many enhancements. Look at the bottom line for initial
help; the F1 key gets you into the Help system.
