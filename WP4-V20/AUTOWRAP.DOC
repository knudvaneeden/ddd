/**************************************************************************
     AutoWrap ... a macro that, when Hooked to _IDLE_, provide
     automatic paragraph wrapping.

     Version .91 ... a slightly refined version of the original.
 **************************************************************************

     û Enable AutoWrap by:

          (a) Compiling autowrap.s using the sc compiler and placing
              the compiled macro wherever it is you usually place
              compiled macro files.

          (b) Adding the line
                    loadmacro('autowrap')
              to your TSE WhenLoaded() macro.

          (c) (optional) If you want to be able to turn autowrap on and off
              manually, adding this menu selection to your TSE config menu:

                    "Auto &Paragraph Wrap"
                         [OnOffStr(GetGlobalInt('AutoWrapOnOff')): 3],
                         SetGlobalInt('AutoWrapOnOff',
                                       NOT GetGlobalInt('AutoWrapOnOff')),
                         DontClose

              and add this proc to your TSE configuration file preceding
              the above menu:

                    string proc OnOffStr(string i)
                         return(iif(GetGlobalInt('AutoWrapOnOff'),
                                    'On',
                                    'Off')
                               )
                    end

          (d) Recompiling TSE.

     û Wrapping is always suppressed if:
          þ The Global integer AutoWrapOnOff is set to 0 or is not set.
          þ TSE WordWrap is turned OFF or Insert mode is OFF.
          þ The cursor is in a block.
          þ Cursor is at or beyond last non-white character, i.e.,
            typing at the end of a line, even if the line is a short one in
            the middle of a paragraph. If you want TSE to wrap under this
            circumstance, delete the line
                  OR CurrPos() > PosLastNonwhite()    // at end of line
            from this file.
          þ The current file extension is not found in the
            autowrap_allowed list in this macro.
          þ The current line has NO non-white character
          þ A key has been pressed.
          þ The proc excluded_paragraph return FALSE. (Customize this proc
            to return false within any paragraph you do not want wrapped.
            Note the the current paragraph is marked as a block before this
            is called, so you can use the 'l' option in lFIND when testing
            for non-wrap conditions.)

     û To avoid screen flicker, wrapping is attempted only every 1/10 second.

     û Wrapping can be forced to happen immediately after selected TSE
       commands (such as DelRtWord, DelBlock, etc.) by use of this small
       proc:

          proc mAutoWrap()
               SetGlobalInt('AutoWrapNOW', 1)
               execmacro('autowrap')
               SetGlobalInt('AutoWrapNOW', 0)
          end

       Include this proc in your main TSE configuration file. Then, for the
       commands that you want to have perform an immediate autowrap--subject
       to the conditions listed above, define them like this:

          <ctrl y>       DelLine() mAutoWrap()

       If you execute commands such as this from the menu, you can create
       commands such as:

          proc mDelLine()
               DelLine()
               mAutoWrap()
          end

       and substitute them for the 'vanilla' commands in the TSE menus.

       Note:

          AutoWrap.s includes a key definition for <ctrl enter>. When you are
          in a paragraph that is subject to auto wrapping and want to insert
          a blank line in the middle of the paragraph, use this key.
