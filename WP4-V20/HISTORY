What Is This???

This package contains a highly customized user interface for the new Semware
Editor (TSE or "Tessie"). Tessie is my idea of the ideal text editor,
providing more functionality than I can use, but with all the features I
need. And Tessie offers the ability to design their own interface ("which
keys do what"). So this interface offers one possible way to set up Tessie's
keyboard assignments. I've been working with this since April '93 and I like
it better all the time. It offers all the flashy features I need at work
with enough left over to satisfy my home use and occasional leap into the
unknown.

I use the editor extensively at work, where I am a software technical
support manager. I manage to get into my share of C code (at home only) and
I do some custom database programming on the side. For programming I
use Tessie exclusively on my own machines; I'll use whatever I have to at a
client site. Sometimes a client's machine doesn't have anything other than
DOS' edit, or even edlin!. Tessie is much better than any other DOS-based
editor I've seen. The programmer's functions make it as good at programming
tasks as vi and emacs

As an example of how good Tessie is, I used it to program itself! (In
computer lingo this is called "bootstrapping", something Windows programmers
understand far too little about.) Try _that_ with edlin...


History of the "WP4Prog" Interface

It usually helps to understand where a program comes from to figure out how
to use it. Here's some background on the wp4prog interface.

I can get very easily confused.

When I started using TSE Jr. I was in the midst of a huge project involving
WordPerfect 4.something and Microsoft's terrible internal QuickBASIC editor.
I installed the WordPerfect emulation package supplied with TSE Jr.. It was
reasonably close, was a whole lot faster than the QB editor, and had more
usable functions. I liked TSE Jr. a lot more than WP in several areas, and
still do, namely the file selection lists and how it handles the
block/mark/copy/move/etc functions.

That TSE Jr./WP emulator was written by Randy Brook, to whom I owe much
thanks. It is very confusing to go from WP to anything else, but his
emulation was close enough to make the jump. To date, I have written two
full length books, complete software documentation, dozens of brochures,
newsletters and pamphlets, hundreds of letters, many class outlines, and so
forth on WordPerfect 4 & 5. I have also written or worked on hundreds of
code files in at least five languages in TSE Jr.. Without Randy's WP enulator
for TSE Jr. I would at best be a hopelessly confused person by now; at worst a
blithering idiot.

The DOS version of TSE Jr. has several flaws that affected me from the start,
all of which are resolved in Tessie. First, TSE Jr. is limited to the size of
conventional available memory. There are times when I run out of memory
because of the size of the files I have to use. Second, TSE Jr. lacks several
key functions that seem very necessary (at least, once you get used to them
somewhere else). Third, TSE Jr.'s macro language is a bit limited. But, even
with these things considered, it is so good that I bought it and used it
over all other choices, including not spending any more money.

I like WP primarily because I am used to it. I'm used to it because I have
to use it at work, and I bought it for simple home typesetting tasks as
well. It is not a perfect program by any stretch -- in fact, if I don't
crash it once a week I don't feel like I'm working hard enough. It can be a
buggy, temperamental monster at times, but it is the largest word processor
on the market judging by number of units sold. In other words, if you go
into a company they will probably use WordPerfect 4 or 5, so if you are a
consultant you better know how to use it.

I don't get confused (much) any more. The WP4Prog interface allows me to use
the major WP function keys and throws in a whole lot more. In my opinion,
Tessie is as close to perfect as software gets. My gratitude goes to Sammy
Mitchell and his hardworking crew.
