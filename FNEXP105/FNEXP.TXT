FNEXP.TXT - Filename Completion
by Chris Antos, chrisant@microsoft.com
v1.05



Description:

    FNEXP provides filename completion in TSE prompt boxes, similar to
    the same way that 4DOS does at the DOS prompt.  FNEXP works in all
    TSE prompts, not just the ones that expect filenames.  This is great
    especially for the "DOS command:" prompt.

    ù When you use <Ctrl Tab> or <Ctrl Spacebar> to pop up the picklist,
      the first file or directory matching what you typed is hilited,
      and you can continue typing to narrow down the match!

    ù When pressing <Tab>, first it cycles through the filenames with
      default extensions, then through the remaining filenames in
      alphabetical order.



Keys:

    <Tab>               - Inserts the next filename that matches what
                          you've typed so far (appending "*.*" when
                          needed).

    <Shift Tab>         - Inserts the previous matching filename.

    <Ctrl Tab>          - Pops up the filename picklist (like TSE used
                          to do when you pressed <Tab>).

    <Ctrl Spacebar>     - Same as <Ctrl Tab>.



Setting Options:

    To get to the options menu, pick Macro->Execute... from the TSE main
    menu.  When it prompts you "Execute macro:", enter "FNEXP -o".

    ù Picklist Always:  this controls whether to use 4DOS-like filename
      completion, or to always use the normal TSE picklist.

    ù AutoEnter:  when this is ON and the picklist is up, pressing
      <Enter> will select the highlighted filename, close the prompt
      box, and continue with the command in progress.  When this is OFF
      and the picklist is up, <Enter> simply inserts the filename into
      the prompt box, and leaves the prompt box open so you can continue
      to edit your response.



Notes:

    FNEXP is compatible with the EDITFILE macro that comes with TSE.  As
    long as AutoEnter is turned on, then when you execute the EDITFILE
    macro and hit <Ctrl Tab>, FNEXP will pass it along to EDITFILE as if
    you had pressed <Tab>, and you can tag multiple files to load,
    delete, etc.



Enjoy!
