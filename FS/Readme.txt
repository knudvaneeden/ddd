                            Notes for users:
   I grew up with Wordstar (from the first through Wordstar for
Windows)and many of the key commands are of necessity an extension of the
basic Worstar set.  Ctrl M and Ctrl J were use to extend control key
functions.  The J set is mostly for help or list functions.  The M set
is for external macros and their control functions.  You can figure out
the coommand set by the Key defs at the end of the UI.

   The menus and help functions are greatly abbreviated since I use key
commands for all commands. If you look and the brief update notes at the
beginning of the UI you will notice my UI has gone through a number of
upgrades. This is simply accomplished by denoting functions/procs as
belonging to Semware or ones I wrote of modified. Comparing new Semware
procs with existing is fairly simple. Open both UI's, position to the
desired proc and the flip between the two UI's.  Differences become very
apparent.

   Changing, adding, or deleting code is done at your own risk.  Most of the
code is non critical.  the command line code is critical. If you do not
understand what is been done, best left alone.
