(12-12-01) SAL Commenting - TSE Pro/32 v2.8+ 
- Macro that allows you to create and        
maintain framed comments with standard       
entries at the top of each proc, menu, keydef
or datadef in a SAL source code file. The    
following features are provided:             
* Procedure comments:                        
  - Generation of standardized comments in   
    front of each proc type structure in a   
    SAL source.                              
  - Customizable appearance of comment frame.
  - Customizable comment frame size and      
    positioning of all subcomments.          
  - Comment editor to create and maintain    
    subcomments.                             
  - Automatic generation and update of       
    "Called by" list.                        
  - Automatic checks for procedures with     
    parameters.                              
  - Automatic checks for procedures with     
    return values.                           
  - Update may be automatic (silent) or      
    interactive (query for empty items).     
* Additional comments:                       
  - Additional comment blocks not releated to
    a proc can be created anywhere between   
    procs.                                   
  - Management of additional comments similar
    to procedure comments.                   
  - Arbitrary parts of the source file can be
    blocked and put into a comment frame.    
  - Headline comments, i.e. headline text    
    framed by two divider lines, can be      
    created anywhere between procs.          
* Miscellaneous:                             
  - Empty lines can be managed. Default      
    behaviour is to delete all empty lines   
    inside and duplicate empty lines outside 
    of proc type struktures.                 
  - The _ON_CHANGING_FILES_ hook is used to  
    determine whether the current file is a  
    SAL source file (extensions .s and .ui). 
    If not, the menu key of the macro is not 
    activated.
