<h1>Readme for Vga2Fon</h1>

<p>Vga2Fon is a tool for converting old DOS VGA fonts into Windows fonts. This
tool was created to help generate monospace fonts for use with <a
href="http://www.semware.com">The Semware Editor Professional</a> (TSE Pro),
but the fonts can be used with any Windows program. Note that the fonts are
bitmap fonts, not TrueType fonts, so they are not scalable.</p>

<h2>Files included</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Vga2fon.exe</b> (5632 bytes, 5/22/2002 10:46pm) -- Windows program that
converts old DOS VGA fonts into Windows fonts.
<li><b>Fed.exe</b> (53110 bytes, 11/26/1990 3:28pm) -- An old (and simple) DOS
program for editing DOS VGA fonts.
<li><b>*.F*</b> -- A collection of sample DOS VGA fonts, that came along with
the old DOS VGA utility called VgaFontMax (also written by me). </ul>

<h2>Using Vga2Fon</h2>

Run <b>vga2fon -?</b> to display help information about how to use the tool.
Basically, you can convert a VGA font by running <b>vga2fon -9 -n "Font Name"
vgafontfile.f14 windowsfontfile.fon</b> where "Font Name" is the name you want
to show up in the Choose Font dialog for Windows programs.</p>

<p>After converting a VGA font into a Windows font, you must install the
Windows font so other Windows programs can use it. Open the Control Panel, and
double click on Fonts. Then drag the Windows font file you converted into the
Fonts folder. Close any Windows programs that are running, and open them again
and the newly installed font will be available.</p>

<h2>Using FED</h2>

<p>To start editing a font, run <b>fed.exe</b> and enter the name of the font
to load. The font editor should be basically straightforward and easy to use,
and there is some help information displayed on the screen.</p>

<p>Note that if you press <Alt-Enter> while running FED in a command prompt
window, this makes the command prompt window switch to fullscreen text mode.
In fullscreen mode, FED even shows the changes to the font while you edit
it.</p>

<p>The VGA fonts saved by FED can be converted into Windows bitmap fonts using
the Vga2fon utility program.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> please don't bother sending feature requests, as I can't do
anything about them. These tools are released as-is, and FED hasn't been
modified in about twelve years. I don't think I even have the source code
anymore.</p>
