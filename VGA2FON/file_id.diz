(06-29-2002) - Vga2Fon is a tool for
converting old DOS VGA fonts into Windows
fonts. This tool was created to help generate
monospace fonts for use with The Semware
Editor Professional (TSE Pro), but the fonts
can be used with any Windows program. Note
that the fonts are bitmap fonts, not TrueType
fonts, so they are not scalable.  See the
readme.htm file for more details.
