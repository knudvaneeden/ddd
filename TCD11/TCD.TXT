                              TCD Version 1.1

Here is a Change Directory/Drive Utility using TSE ("The Semware Editor" by
Semware Corporation) and it's powerful macro language.

I have been working on a Novell Network where the directory paths get kind
of long and complicated. I was using Norton's Change Directory NCD, but for
it to work quickly it wants to write a reference file in the root directory
of each drive. I'm not authorized to write to the root directory of my
network drive -- so Norton was kind of slow. I looked at a couple of other
change directory programs, but I really wasn't satisfied with any particular
one.

So, here is how it all works...

TCD requires a single directory reference file (TCD.DIR) and it is stored on
the C: Drive. (The drive/path location of this reference file can be changed
by editing the TCD.BAT and TCDSCAN.BAT.)

After you have configured TCD, established the reference file and compiled
TCD -- you are ready to start using it. TCD uses the TSE Regular Expression
search capability, so wildcards are supported

TCD dir_spec [command to execute]

dir_spec  - this can be the directory name, only a portion of the name or a
            string that contains the normal DOS wildcard characters or TSE
            Regular Expression Characters.

            Examples: TCD tse     ; goes to c:\tse
                      TCD ROCC    ; goes to d:\procomm
                      TCD E:*TEMP ; goes to e:\temp
                      TCD *DAT*   ; goes to the first directory that
                                    includes DAT in it's name. Some possible
                                    matches might be DATA, COMDATA, GOODDAT
                                    or BAD.DAT
                      TCD C       ; first directory that contains 'C' in the
                                    path
                      TCD C:      ; goes to c:\

            TCD does not support syntax like CD ..\..\TEMP or CD C: (CD
            stays in the current directory on the C: Drive, TCD changes to
            the root of the C: Drive) -- just used CD <grin>

command to execute -
           After TCD tries to change to the directory that you've entered,
           it will then pass the remaining arguments to DOS for execution.
           NOTE: TCD does not do any checking to see if the change was made
           -- so it is possible that the command will be executed in the
           wrong directory.

           Examples: TCD data e engdata.603 ; TCD will change to
                                              e:\data and then run TSE
                                              telling it to load ENGDATA.603
                     TCD PCP PCPLUS         ; TCD will change to c:\pcplus
                                              and then start Procomm Plus

How to get started...

1) Compile the TCD macro, SC TCD

2) I use a DOS environment variable (MACPATH) that points to TSE and my
macros. This variable needs to include the trailing backslash.

    For example:   set macpath=e:\tse\

3) Run TCDSCAN. This requires DOS 5 or greater. I use the new switches that
are available with the DIR command.

The syntax for the TCDSCAN is  TCDSCAN d: [[d:] ...]

     For example: TCDSCAN c: d:

Notes/Hints:

    The TCD.DIR can be edited to add directories, change the order of the
    directories or remove directories. I removed some of the directories
    that were included on the network drive.
