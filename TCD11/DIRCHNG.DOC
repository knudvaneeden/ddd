The following macro will cause TSE to change to the directory that you load
a file from.  To use this macro, add the following code on after the
#include lines at the top of the TSE.S file located in your UI sub-directory:

/************************************************************************
    ;
    ; This comment is just to show the code that is in the BIN file.
    ; It does not have to be included in your file.
    ;
    ; integer cd(string s)
    ;
    ; cd('..' + Chr(0))
    ;
    ; long PASCAL cd(uchar *far string);
    ;
    ;                       bp+06 seg string
    ;                       bp+04 ofs string
    ;                       bp+02 seg ret
    ;                       bp+00 ofs ret
    ;
    cd proc
            mov     bp,sp
            lds     dx,[bp+4]               ; ofs string
            inc     dx                      ; move past the length
            inc     dx                      ;    word
            mov     ah,3bh                  ; change dir
            int     21h                     ; dos call
            mov     ax, 0                   ; assume error...
            jc      @@exit
            inc     ax                      ; single success
    @@exit:
            cwd
            retf
    cd endp
 ************************************************************************/

binary ['dirchng.bin']
    integer proc cd(string dir):0
end

proc mEditFile()
    string temp[80] = ''
    EditFile()
    LogDrive(SplitPath(CurrFilename(),_DRIVE_))
    temp = SplitPath(CurrFilename(), _PATH_)
    if temp <> '\'
        temp = SubStr(temp, 1, Length(temp) - 1)
    endif
    cd(temp + Chr(0))
end

Once you have done this, change the line in your MENU FileMenu()(located in
the section of the TSE.S file titled 'The Menus') from:

    "&Open..."                      ,   EditFile()

to:

    "&Open..."                      ,   mEditFile()

Then in the TSE.KEY file in your UI sub-directory change the line:

    <Alt e>                 Editfile()

to:

    <Alt e>                 mEditfile()

This uses a binary file DIRCHNG.BIN (found in this ZIP file).  Place the BIN
file in your UI sub-directory.

Once you have made the modification to your TSE files, move to your \TSE
directory (the directory where you installed TSE) and use SC.EXE to update
your E.EXE.  To run SC use the following syntax:

SC -b ui\tse

Once you have made these modifications, TSE will change to the directory
where you load a file from.
