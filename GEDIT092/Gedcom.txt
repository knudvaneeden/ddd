    Gedcom - Edit GEDCOM genealogical databases

    1. INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The Gedcom macro package is designed to help you edit GEDCOM
    genealogical databases.

    The Gedcom file format is quite common in the world of
    genealogical software.  Pretty well every genealogical
    software program either uses it or can import from it and
    export to it.

    The format is fairly self-explanatory.  There are individuals:

        0 @I15@ INDI
        1   NAME Anne Elizabeth Alice /Windsor/
        1   TITL Princess
        1   SEX F
        1   BIRT
        2     DATE Tuesday, 15th August 1950
        2     PLAC Clarence House,St. James,,England
        1   CHR
        2     DATE Saturday, 21st October 1950
        2     PLAC ,,,England
        1   FAMS @F7@
        1   FAMC @F6@
        1   RIN 16

    And there are families:

        0 @F7@ FAM
        1   HUSB @I16@
        1   WIFE @I15@
        1   CHIL @I17@
        1   CHIL @I18@
        1   DIV N
        1   MARR
        2     DATE Wednesday, 14th November 1973
        2     PLAC Westminster,Abbey,London,England
        1   RIN 99

    Each section is nested (the number at the beginning of the line
    indicates the nesting level).  Although they are usually
    indented, the indenting isn't important.

    An individual's name contains slashes (/) before and after
    the surname.  In the above example, Anne's surname is Windsor.

    Individuals and families are cross-linked to each other.
    For instance, in the above example, Anne Windsor (individual I15)
    is a spouse in the family F7.  Not only does she contain a link
    to this family (FAMS) but within the family block, she is also
    listed as WIFE.

    Some common link tags used by the gedcom macro:

        FAMC - Family (as child)
        FAMS - Family (as spouse)
        CHIL - Child
        HUSB - Husband
        WIFE - Wife

    More information on the GEDCOM format can be found in the official
    GEDCOM standard (PostScript and WordPerfect formats):

    2. INSTALLATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Place the gedcom.s and gedkeys.si files in your macro source
    directory.  Compile gedcom.s.

    Edit your gedcom database.  Note that it must have
    the extension ".ged" for the macro to work properly

    The default key definitions are as follows:
        <Ctrl G>       List individuals
        <CtrlShift G>  List families
        <CtrlAlt G>    Link menu
        <CtrlAlt M>    Global Gedcom Menu

    See the CONFIGURATION section, below, for information on
    changing these key assignments.


    3. USAGE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The best way to learn to use this macro is to experiment!

    Every function is available from one of the menus.

    Experiment with adding and deleting individuals, and changing
    families around by changing the values of the links they contain.

    Note that the macro doesn't perform any kind of sophisticated
    integrity checking on your file, so it's quite possible to create
    a situation where your grandfather is married to himself and has you
    as both his mother and his uncle.  The menus are there for your
    convenience; they do not constrain your data in any way.


    4. CONFIGURATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    To change the key bindings used by gedcom.s, edit the gedkeys.si
    file in your macro directory.

    Note that this keydef will only be active if the extension
    of the current file is ".ged".

    I designed the "List Individuals" function to be similar to the
    built in TSE "List Functions" command.  So it is bound by default
    to <Ctrl G>, which (in TSE.UI) is bound to "List Functions".
