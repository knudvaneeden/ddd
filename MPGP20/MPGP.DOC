8/25/94 Ver. 2.0

Additions and Changes:

  1. Added picklist for choosing Public Keys istead of typing in
     a part of the users name.

  2. Added the ability to create the Public Key list for the picklist
     procedure. This has been made automatic, if the keylist is not
     there, it will be created. I also added a menu selection to manually
     create this list for user after updates to the Public Keyring.

  3. Consolidated much of the code regarding Keyfile selection and Public
     Key selection.

This version has not currently been tested on TSE versions prior to
1.53b. If you any would like to test it on the Prerelease version, I
would greatly appreciate knowing if it works. I have asked Semware to post
this only to the Beta Testers.

I hope this makes MPGP easier to use. If you have any other suggestions or
implemetations, please let me know.

This update it made possible due to the assistance of George De Bruin of
Semware's Technical Support Team, Thanks for the help George.

Ver 1.2
This is a minor bug fix for MPGP.

I discovered that one of the toggle configurations didn't function properly.
I made this fix in EPGP()

    if(GetGlobalInt("Radix") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("Sign") == 1
       and GetGlobalInt("Text") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("Unix") == 1)
        opt = "-feast "
    elseif (GetGlobalInt("Radix") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("Sign") == 1
       and GetGlobalInt("Text") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("More") == 1)
        opt = "-steam "
    elseif (GetGlobalInt("Radix") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("Sign") == 1
        and GetGlobalInt("Text") == 1 and GetGlobalInt("ClearSig") == 1)
        opt = "-sta +clearsig=on "
        noask = 1

// The last elseif in the abovce statement was not being interpreted due to
// the fact that it was lacated at the end of the if - endif loop.

    ...

    endif

INSTALLATION

Place this macro in your source directory.

Make sure that PGP is installed properly, and that the environment variable
PGPPATH is set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

At line 561 is is the start of UserGlobals(), these are the defaults for the
operation of this macro. Change these to your liking.

Make sure you change line 572 to contain your name as it was used to create
your Public/Secret key pair.

OPERATION

I suggest that you place this as a menu option in your main menu. I have
placed it under my Options Pulldown Menu, this seems to be a good place for
it.

The default is to encrypt what is in the editor using Public Key encryption
(instead of conventional), to Sign the message with your Secret key, and to
produce output in Radix-64 format for transmission as e-mail.

The Toggles can be changed as you like for any particular valid operation.

I have attempted to make this macro as intuitive as possible. If you have
any comments, question, or suggetions, please feel free to e-mail me on the
Semware BBS or via Internet: highmage@astral.scvl.ca.us

Here is my Public Key, include it in your Public Key Ring, and feel free to
use it to encrypt any e-mail to me.
