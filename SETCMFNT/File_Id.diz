(06-02-04) SetCmFnt.s - TSE Pro GUI versions.
When starting CharMap, the standard Windows
character chart, from within TSE, it starts
for the last font selected in CharMap.
By always running this macro first, CharMap
starts for the current TSE font instead.
Also works before Dieter Koessl's WinDlgs.
