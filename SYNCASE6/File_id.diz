(Sep 4, 2005) SynCase v6 for TSE Pro 2.5 and 2.8 thru 4.4.
When you are typing it formats known sets of keywords to their predefined
combination of upper and lower case letters.
Or you can "case" a whole file at once.
From TSE Pro 2.8 upwards it uses TSE's own syntax hiliting keywords to
determine their predefined casing.
For TSE Pro 2.5 it is preconfigured for TSE's own macro language and Cobol.
For higher TSE Pro versions it contains a "cased" SAL syntax hiliting file
wich in SynCase v5 was updated for TSE Pro 4.4.
SynCase v6 makes SynCase clean up its _edit_file_ history, which was
disturbing the OpenType macro.
