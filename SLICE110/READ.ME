Using Slice
-----------

The slice macro allows you to split larger files into smaller pieces using
TSE Pro-32. Using slice is easy:

    (a)     execute the macro
    (b)     choose a file to split
            (either type the filename of press enter to pick one)
    (c)     choose a size for the slices

The individual slices will be named by appending numerical extensions to the
original filename. E.g., if your large file is foo.zip, your slices will be
foo.zip.001, foo.zip.002, etc.

To reassemble the slices use the following dos command:

    copy /b foo.zip.001 + foo.zip.002 [+ ...] foo.zip

The /b switch is important, otherwise dos would stop copying a slice at the
first null character it encounters.


Using the batch files
---------------------

First of all, the batch files need JP Software's 4dos (or one of its
siblings) to execute. If you don't own one of these, you're out of luck,
since the command shells provided with any MS product cannot interpret the
extended syntax.

The batch files simplify using slice even more. To split a file type

    slice foo.zip

at the command line and choose a size for your slices at TSE's menu. To
reassemble the slices use

    glue foo.zip.001

The numerical extension, e.g. 001, is mandatory. The reason is that slices
usually include multiple dots and therefore there is no straight forward way
to provide a default extension. Moreover, at the 4dos prompt it's easy to
enter the somewhat longer filename by using filename completion.
