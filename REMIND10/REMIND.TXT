REMIND is Reminder or ToDo Macro for the The Semware Editor (TSE). REMIND
checks the computer system clock and then searches in the REMIND.DAT file to
see if any days fall within the designated date range.

Files included:

    REMIND.S    -- Reminder Macro
    REMIND.DAT  -- Sample data file
    REMIND.BAT  -- Batch file to execute REMIND
    REMIND.TXT  -- Documentation for REMIND

REMIND.BAT uses a DOS Environment Variable (MACPATH) to find REMIND.MAC and
REMIND.DAT. The value of this variable is the path to these files including
the trailing '\'. For example: c:\tse\

Current settings within REMIND:


proc MAIN() // line 134 in REMIND.S
  integer MinDateColumn = 1    // Event dates are found in columns
                               //    MinDateColumn to MaxDateColumn
  integer MaxDateColumn = 15   // Event dates are found in columns
                               //    MinDateColumn to MaxDateColumn
  integer MaxDateAdder  = 7    // curr date + MaxDateAdder = MaxDate
                               // valid range 0 to 10

REMIND will only search columns 1 to 15 for the date of the event. This can
 be changed by editing the program and recompiling.

REMIND searches a 7 day date range. The MaxDateAdder can be set to 0 through
10. Numbers less than 0 or larger than 10 will probably produce funny results.

Date format:

The dates are in month, day and year format (mm/dd/yyyy). The separator can
be a '.', '/' or '\'. The century can be left off of the year.

REMIND.BAT:

REMIND.S can easily be used on any file as long as the dates are within the
columns that REMIND.S is configured to search and in the proper date format
(month, day and year). REMIND.S does not have any file designations
specified within it, so the file that is searched depends on when you
execute the REMIND Macro.

Below is the REMIND.BAT file.

@echo off
rem REMIND.BAT 06/12/1993 06/12/1993
%MACPATH%e.exe %MACPATH%remind.dat -eremind

FIND History:

The History for the FIND command is loaded with the regular expression for
the current date range. This makes searching for additional dates easier.

I hope that you find this useful
