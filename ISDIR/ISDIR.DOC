IsDir Routine for TSE by RW Klein
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

IsDir is a simple binary routine.  It takes one a string parameter and
determines if that string contains a valid directory name.

Here is an example:

        sFname="\DOS"
        if IsDir(sFname)
            sFname=PickFile(sFname)
        endif

In the above example, if "\DOS" is a directory then the user can select a
file from that directory.


To use IsDir
컴컴컴컴컴컴

    (1) Put ISDIR.BIN into a directory called \TSE\ASM\

    (2) Add the following lines to VID.S in \TSE\UI\TSE.S.

            binary "\tse\asm\IsDir.bin"
                integer proc IsDir(string DirName):0
            end

    (3) Burn in the new configuration using SC.EXE :

            CD \TSE\UI
            SC -b..\E.EXE TSE



=========================================================
Technical Note:

When the string is passed to IsDir, it is in TSE format.  It is not
zero-terminated, that is, ASCIIZ.  DOS function calls, of course, require
ASCIIZ strings.

Instead of copying the string and adding a zero, I just put a zero at the
end of the passed string.  I saved the byte that the zero replaced and
restored it at the end of the routine.

The assumption I am making is that TSE will not be using that byte during
any interrupt service routines while IsDir is running.  I believe this to be
a pretty safe assumption, but you never know!

Anyhow, this macro is free!  What do you expect??!!!

good luck!
