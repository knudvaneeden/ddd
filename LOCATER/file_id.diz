LOCATER.zip contains two Tse macros that
solve (at least to the extent of paragraphs)
the age-old problem of DOS EOLs that break
multiple-word search efforts when the target
words are split across lines.
LocateNextTo.mac will find words where one
follows the other, but the first is at the
end of one line, and the other is at the
beginning of the next line. LocateNear.mac
allows finding words or phrases that are in
the same paragraph, with any number of words,
spaces, or line-breaks between.  Tested under
Tse 2.5 with 2032 line length, and under 4.0
with 16000 line length.
