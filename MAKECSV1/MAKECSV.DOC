A Macro that converts a datafile with positionally oriented
records to a Comma Separated Value (.CSV) file.

    Features:

        o   Can include a header line.
        o   Use any part or all of of the source file.
        o   Output fields in a different order than the source
            file.
        o   Does not change the source file.

Useful in formatting many kinds of database output for import
into a spreadsheet.

A positionally oriented record is one where each field length the
same as that field length in all other records.  Field data are
padded with blanks. Blanks follow character fields and normally
preceed numeric fields.  This is a common format in older
databases.

A Comma Separated Value record has each field separated by a
comma.  Fields are only as long as the data in them.  Character
fields are surrounded by double quotes. Numeric fields are not.
.CSV fields are commonly used to exchange data between DOS and
Macintosh databases and spreadsheets.

    Examples:

    Positionally oriented record file.

    First_Name      Last_name      Age Salary
    Joseph          Blow            23  13000.25
    Maggie          Malone          21  93072.01

    Comma Separated Value file.

    "First_Name,"Last_name","Age","Salary",
    "Joseph","Blow",23,13000.25,
    "Maggie","Malone",21,93072.01,

    Note:  Some applications may not allow you to include a
    header with all string data with fields containing numeric
    data.  In this case, omit the header data in the DEFINEcc.RCD
    file (See following.)


MakeCSV requires a file named DEFINEcc.RCD where cc can be any
two characters.  The format of this file is one line for each
field desired in the output file. Leave no blank lines.  Each
line is formatted as follows:

    [Field Name], Beginning Column, Field Length, Character Field (Y/N?),

    Where:

        Field Name is a single string less than 16 characters. It
        is omisible if not desired in the output, however, if
        omitted for one field, it must be omitted for all.  When
        used, the field name will be entered into a header line
        in the output file.

        Beginning Column is the starting column of the field in
        the source file.

        Field Length is the width, maximum the number of
        characters, in the source file field.

        Character Field (Y/N?) indicates whether the field
        contains characters other than numbers, a leading "-" or
        a single decimal.

    Example:

        Last_Name,1,16,Y,
        First_Name,17,16,Y,
        Age,32,3,N,

    Fields must be defined in the order they are to appear in the .CSV
    file, but not every field in the input need be used nor do fields
    need to be in the same order as in the source file.

    Results are placed in file RESULTcc.CSV where "cc" is the same
    characters as used in the suffix to DEFINEcc.RCD.
