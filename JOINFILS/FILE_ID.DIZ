<08-22-98>       TSE Pro v2.5 and Pro/32 v2.8
This macro joins two ascii files together,
which have a key in common on certain column
positions.

See the macro source for a more detailed
description.

Note to TSE 2.80 users: If you have a sort
macro that is older than 17 august 1998, then
you need to update your sort macro with the
included sort macro.
