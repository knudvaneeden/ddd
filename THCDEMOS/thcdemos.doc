For help with THC.ZIP or THCDEMOS.ZIP questions, email billh@gci.net.

To run the demos successfully, you will need to setup a directory C:\RTP
and extract or move the contents of THCDEMOS.ZIP into that directory.

The contents of THC.ZIP can be extracted into that directory or another
directory which is included in your PATH statement.  The system from which
these are extracted has an icon called SEARCH RTP on a desktop.  When it
is double-clicked, it runs the SEARCH.BAT program.  The command line in the
icon is CMD.EXE /k C:\RTP\SEARCH.BAT, and it starts in C:\RTP.  The SEARCH.BAT
file simply reminds users that they can type HELP to see a help list of
available commands.  Only three of those commands are provided in this demo.
The searching of USA_LOCS.TXT using the MATCH program is provided by QUS.BAT
and QUSID.BAT.  MATCH finds matches in LINES of text.

The QUS program searches the entire file for one or two
arguments provided on the command line.  These will usually be city names,
but can include a state designation in the form of ", st" where st is the
standard state abbreviation for the state.  QUSID searches only the first four
characters of the USA_LOCS.TXT looking for a location identifier, the three
or four characters found on your baggage claim tag after taking a flight
somewhere and checking some baggage.

The F program searches the Facility Description file for the description
of a facility included in the National Airspace System (NAS).  It uses the
PPM (Paragraph Pattern Match) program to search only the first line of each
paragraph looking for the acronym you provide on the command line as the
argument to the command.  Example: F ADAS

The F, QUS and QUSID scripts provide help if called with no arguments.  The
help is generated from the COLORMSG utility.
