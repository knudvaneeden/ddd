ADS-B (S10) ADSB                                 NOT FSEP
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast

ADS-B is a technique for reporting aircraft position information from
an onboard global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver or other
backup source of navigation data.  Aircraft identity, altitude,
velocity, and position are broadcast directly to ground receivers and
to nearby aircraft.  Transmitted ADS-B messages received by nearby
aircraft are processed, displayed on an airborne cockpit display of
traffic information (CDTI), and used for situational awareness,
conflict detection, and Free Flight capabilities.  Accurate and timely
reports from ADS-B minimize runway incursions and improve safety by
increasing pilot situational awareness of nearby aircraft and improve
efficiency and airspace capacity by potentially reducing current
separation standards.

A computerized central operations facility in the flight advisory system.  It
has automated data acquisition and transmission capability for centralized
flight plan processing and flight advisory services; i.e., weather information
consolidation and dissemination, notices to airmen (NOTAMs), pilot briefings,
and other en route and terminal flight services in the NAS.  It may also provide
aeronautical point to point communications such as flight plan processing,
weather information, search and rescue action, and other flight assistance
operations to pilots operating over international territory or waters.
Environmental workload will be point-counted against the ATBM facility.  Engine
generator workload is identified by power source code (see Order 6000.5).  AFSS
encompasses automation equipment only (e.g., Model I Full Capacity or OASIS);
communications equipment is captured under the FSS, MCT and RCO facilities.  An
FSS (with suffix "Z" added to the location identifier) must be established in
the FSEP for each AFSS location. For each AFSS/FSS combination, there will be
only one ATBM to capture environmental workload.

The ALS is a high intensity approach light system with sequence flashers.  It is
an airport runway lighting facility providing guidance by radiating high
intensity focused light beams in a directional pattern by which the pilot
visually aligns the aircraft with the extended centerline of the runway.
Staffing values are assigned by facility class, which defines a system by its
configuration and category of operations and includes all environmental maint-
enance for the facility.  Engine generator staffing values are determined by
power source code (latest edition of Order 6000.5).  No distinction is made,
in classes, between landline, ground to ground (G/G), air to ground (A/G), etc.,
since the associated workload, for the addition of communications, totals only
some 6 man-hours per year (negligible and is included in all allowances).  See
the following for definition of category and class:
-
a. ALS-1. This configuration consists of a centerline light bar approximately
   12-1/2 ft long with 5 equally spaced lights at each light station and contin-
   uing out to 2400 or 3000 ft from the threshold.  The 2400-ft system is auth-
   orized by the latest edition of Order 6850.9, Revised Approach Light
   Criteria, when the glide slope angle is 2.75 degrees or higher, while the
   3000 ft system is authorized when the glide slope angle is less than 2.75
   degrees.  All light bars are installed perpendicular to the extended runway
   centerline, and all lights are aimed away from the runway threshold.  The
   centerline light bar at 1,000 ft from the threshold is supplemented with
   eight additional lights on either side, forming a light bar of 100 ft and 21
   lights.  This bar is called the 1000-ft distance marker crossbar (or simply
   1000-ft bar).  All of the aforementioned lights are white.  The light bar
   200 ft from the threshold is 50 ft long, contains 11 red lights and is called
   the terminating bar.  Two light bars, each containing five red lights, are
   located 100 ft from the threshold, one on either side of the centerline, and
   are called wing bars.  The inner light (nearest to runway centerline) of each
   wing bar is located in line with the runway edge lights.  A row of green
   lights on 5-ft centers is located near the threshold and extends across the
   runway threshold and outwards a distance of approximately 45 ft from the
   runway edge on either side of the runway.  These lights are called the
   threshold bar.
-
b. ALS-2. This configuration differs from the configuration of an ALS-1 only in
   the inner 1000 ft (nearest the threshold of the system).  The outer 1400 or
   2000 ft of both systems are identical.  The 2400-ft system is authorized by
   Order 6850.9 when the glide slope angle is 2.75 degrees or higher, while the
   3000-ft system is authorized when the glide slope is less than 2.75 degrees.
   The terminating bar and wing bars of the Category I configuration are
   replaced with centerline bars of five white lights each.  In addition, there
   are light bars (three red lights each) on either side of the centerline bars
   at each light station in the inner 1000 ft.  These are called side row bars.
   Also, there is an additional bar 500 ft from the threshold.  These lights
   form a crossbar referred to as the 500-ft bar.

The oceanic enhancement program will evolve into the Advance Oceanic Automation
System (AOAS) to provide a near real-time oceanic air traffic management system
that incorporates the capabilities of interim situation displays (ISD).  The
telecommunications processor (TP) will provide a local area network (LAN)
capability and replace the cathode ray tube (CRT), keyboard and remote control
unit (RCU) elements of flight data input/output (FDIO).  The ISD will emulate
the current PVD functions, using a hardware/software architecture, which
provides the display, and processing capabilities to support FDPS functions.
The ODL capabilities will be provided through replacement of the TP software.
Changes to the ODAPS, the existing OAS system, will be kept to a minimum.  This

The Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) consists of two sites: the Transmitter
Receiver (T/R) and the Indicator sites.  The T/R site includes some but not all
of the following equipment: transmitters, receivers, antenna, processors,
Surveillance & Communication Interface Processor (SCIP), Surveillance Data
Translator (SDT), modems and control units.  The indicator site includes some
but not all of the following equipment: distribution units, SCIP, SDT, modems
and control units.

The ASR uses a tower mounted continually rotating antenna to transmit electro-
magnetic waves, which reflect from the surface of aircraft.  The radar system
measures the time and direction of the radar signal.  From this data, the system
can then measure the azimuth and distance of the aircraft from the radar
antenna.  The ASR operates in the range of 2700 to 2900 MHz with an operating
range of 60 miles.

ASR-7s and ASR-8s are analog radars at medium to low traffic activity airports.
These radars do not provide digital inputs to the Standard Terminal Automation
Replacement System (STARS).  ASR-8 sites are being equipped with interim
digitizers to enable the STARS interface.  These digitizers are captured in the
FSEP under the Common Digitizer (CD) facility type.

The ASR-9 provides digital terminal primary surveillance plus six-level weather,
at high activity airports and support facilities. The ASR-11 is the digital
radar that replaces the ASR-7, ASR-8, ATCRB and MODES at medium to low activity
airports. It consists of two electronic subsystems: a primary surveillance radar
(PSR) and a monopulse secondary surveillance radar beacon (MSSR).

The MSSR uses a second radar antenna attached to the top of the primary radar
antenna to transmit and receive area aircraft's altitude, identification code,
and/or emergency conditions.  The MSSR operates at 1030 and 1090 MHz, with
transmitting power range from 160 to 1500 watts.

Staffing includes buildings and grounds, HVAC, and other environmental support
utilities.  Engine generator staffing values (UPT included) are determined by
the power source code.

ASWON (W01)
Aviation Surface Weather Observation Network

The ASWON is an evolving system; as new technology becomes available
and cost-effective, it is incorporated into the ASWON through the FAA
acquisition management system (AMS) process.  The ASWON consists of:
Automated weather systems (AWOS/ASOS), Automated Weather Observing
System Data Acquisition System (ADAS), Data display systems (AWOS
controller equipment (ACE)), Aviation weather sensors, including
F420 wind sensors and manual sling psychrometers.

The Asynchronous Concentrator (ASYNC) is the device and/or software that allows
for the concentration of several asynchronous remote maintenance monitoring
data streams into a single output stream.  ASYNC receives data inputs from
multiple devices (ERMS, ASDE-3, ATCBI-6, other ASYNCs et.) these inputs are
combined into a composite data response for transfer to the next level
processor (another ASYNC or MPS).

The ASYNC device can be a standalone Windows 2000 compatible personnel
computer, or with the installation of the ASYNC software, be embedded into
another system's processor.

service facilities, TRACO (not collocated with the tower), stand-alone SMO/SSC
offices, CBI, and other stand-alone buildings if not collocated with tower
base/ARTCC buildings (medical building, child care facility, etc.).  This is a
point-count facility and staffing is based on the percent of total workload,
generated by the equipment inventory, which is actually accomplished by FAA
personnel.  The appropriate percentage of contract maintenance should be
identified in the FSEP for any portion of maintenance not performed by FAA
personnel.  This inventory includes air-conditioning, heating, water systems,
electrical power distribution, janitorial and grounds, elevators, rest rooms,
etc.  Environmental workload associated with tower facilities will be captured
under TOWB.  See Order 1380.40C, table 6 of appendix 2 for equipment/system
point-count values.  ARSR facilities, and other like facilities, are not
permitted to establish this facility since the facility standard includes the
environmental workload.

The Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon (ATCRB) is a ground-based system that
interrogates an airborne transponder and receives replies permitting a positive
means of identifying airborne aircraft for air traffic control purposes.
This system provides secondary radar surveillance capability at airport
surveillance radar (ASR) and air route surveillance radar (ARSR) sites to
sustain the safe and efficient movement of aircraft.  Newer systems will
provide digital data capable of being translated into proper automation system
serial or parallel digital format and sent to the system's air traffic control
computers.  This radar beacon is collocated with ARSR or ASR facilities.
Staffing values for this system include the workload for the defruiter
equipment.  This facility does not generate environmental workload.

The terminal air traffic control system air/ground radio communications utilized
for safe and expeditious movement of aircraft operating within the controlled
airspace of the tower.  This is all the equipment from and including the
controller's position to and including FAA's DEMARC.  It includes all four-
channel equipment, tone channeling, amplifiers, tie lines, regulators, power
supplies and associated jacks, and jack fields needed to send and receive
communications from local or remote communications facilities.  This is a core
facility and staffing values are determined by the total number of radio
positions combined for both the tower and the approach control facility
(training positions are not counted).  A radio position is defined as a
location which provides air traffic the operational capability of establishing
and maintaining radio communications with aircraft.  Emergency transceivers are
included in the staffing values.  An RTR facility, with suffix Z added to the
location identifier, should be established in the FSEP to capture all
transmitters, receivers, and etc., installed in the equipment room or tower
building.  Maintenance transceivers are captured under the MCT facility alpha.
Environmental support is counted against TOWB.  Engine generator workload is
identified by power source code.  (See order 6000.5.).  Classes H-P shall also
establish an ICSS or TVS facility in the FSEP for capturing the remaining
workload transferred to those facilities.

The Advance Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) is a Commercial
Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) air traffic control system.
The ATOP is designed to operate in a radar environment as well as in
procedural/non-radar airspace.  ATOP provides Surveillance Data Processing
(SDP).  The SDP processes primary and secondary radar, Automatic Dependent
Surveillance (ADS, both Addressable: ADS-A and Broadcast: ADS-B), and
Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) position reports.  It also
processes relayed High Frequency (HF) radio voice pilot position reports from
an HF radio operator employed by a communications service provider under
contract to the FAA.  ATOP supports radar and non-radar procedural separation,
tracking clearances issued via CPDLC or messages through the HF radio service
provider.  It performs conflict detection/prediction through the use of
controller tools (Conflict Alert and Minimum Safe Altitude Warning for radar
airspace and Conflict Probe for non-radar procedural separation applications).
And, it performs fully automated coordination, via the Air Traffic Services
Interfacility Data Communications System (AIDCS), with AIDCS equipped facilities
in adjacent Flight Information Regions (FIRs).  The ATOP interfacility data
communications system supports the ICAO air traffic services message set.
ATOP places on the display, the information and primary capabilities required
for the controller to maintain situational awareness and to provide procedural
separation services.
-
ATOP equipment employs dual channel architecture with dual Local Area Networks
within each channel.  Each server and user position processor is attached to
the two LANs.  All processors in the system are International Business Machines
(IBM) RISC/6000 B80s.  Each channel consists of an External Communication
Server, Surveillance Data Processing and SARS Server (SDPS), Flight Data
Processing Server (FDPS), Display Recording and Playback Server (DRPS),
Monitor and Control Position Processor (MCPP), Flight Data Repair Position
Processor (FDRPP), Supervisor Position Processor (SPP) and Controller
Workstation Processor (CWP).
-
Controller workstations consists of two CWPs (one for each channel), Sony 2Kx2K
main display monitor (MDM), NEC 20.1 inch flat panel display, keyboard, mouse
and audio alarm device.
-
Build 2 will add MEARTS software to the system for radar processing.

The AWSS is a weather observing system that uses the latest sensor technology
to automatically measure selected weather parameters; process the information;
store a limited amount of the data; and disseminate the information direct to
users via ground-to-air radio broadcast; display terminals; telephone dial-up,
and long-line transmission. AWSS provides accurate, real-time observations with
minute-by-minute updates around the clock.  The data is voice synthesized to
provide a report that can be transmitted via Very High Frequency (VHF) radio,
Non-Directional Radio Beacon (NDB), or Very High Frequency Omni-directional
Range Beacon (VOR) to ensure pilots on approach have exact weather conditions
at the facility. This voice data report is also available by telephone, so that
current conditions can be obtained from anywhere.

The Capstone Communication Control System (CCCS) Critical Services Unit (CSU)
is a real time gateway server that receives Automatic Dependent Surveillance -
Broadcast (ADS-B) aircraft position reports and status messages from a Ground
Based Transceiver (GBT) and in turn passes the ADS-B data to the Micro Enroute
Automated Radar Tracking System (MEART).  The CCCS is one component within the
ADS-B domain.  The MEART processes the ADS-B radar-like targets and displays
them on air traffic controller (ATC) display workstations, fused with other
radar-generated targets.  ADS-B provides the controller with position ident-
ification, speed, heading, and altitude, from ADS-B equipped aircraft.
CCCS CSU consists of multiple Core Switch Channel Bank (CSCB) Assemblies, two
Local Area Networks (LAN), two Critical Services LAN Switches (CSLS), a
Keyboard-Video-Mouse Station (KVM) and the Keyboard-Video-Mouse Switch (KVM
Switch).  Each CSCB Assembly consists of a Sun Blade 100 workstation, which is
a uniprocessor system that uses the UltraSPARC family of processors, connected
to a Breakout Box (BB) that provides 16 serial channels.  The CCCS CSU with
Flight Information Services - Broadcast (FIS-B), facility code 68JB, adds the
FIS-B server processor, interface to external weather sensors (NEXRAD) or
servers (WMSCR, WARP/WIN), and handling of the FIS-B messages which establishes
the FIS-B uplink capability.  FIS-B consists of one FIS-B server, one Essential
Services Local Area Network (ESLAN), one Essential Services LAN Switch (ESLS),
one Essential Services Protocol Converter (ESPC), and a Keyboard-Video-Mouse
(KVM) station.  The FIS-B is connected to the CSCB via the ESLS.  The CSCB in
turn provides the essential service products to the Ground Based Transceiver
(GBT) for uplink to the aircraft.

Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is a subsystem within the
Aeronautical Data Link System (ADLS) and provides the global air/ground (A/G)
digital data communication capability required to alleviate communications
problems in the current voice environment and to support advanced capabilities
in the future.  It is in the En Route Traffic Control System and enables digital
data communications exchange between air traffic controllers and pilots.  At
ARTCCs, CPDLC interfaces with the Host computer system and controller display
via the HID/NAS LAN (HNL).

CPDLC Build 1 is composed of the following components: the Data Link
Applications Processor (DLAP) platform, the Context Management Application (CMA)
platform, the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) Router platform, the
area supervisor workstations (ASW), the supervisor local area network (ASLAN),
and the Service Certification Suite (SCS). (See Notes)

The DLAP provides the basic message service and display functionality.  It
processes the uplink and downlink messages exchanged between pilots and
controllers, and maintains outstanding messages in a transaction database.

The CMA is the gate and record keeper, and provides the address resolution
function.  It processes logon messages by way of the Very High Frequency Digital
Link Mode 2 (VDL-2) service provider and stores the unique aircraft
identification information in a database.

The DLAP uses the CMA database to obtain the address of the aircraft and uses
the address to transmit messages to an aircraft.

The ATN Router platform for CPDLC Build 1 consists of two routers, one primary
and one backup, installed at the key site (i.e. Miami ARTCC).

The SCS consists of redundant VHF radios and supporting processors installed at
the key site.  It provides a means by which the Airway Transportation System
Specialist (ATSS) can certify the system.

The Build 1 ASW function will be implemented using the HNL Monitor and Control
(M&C) consoles.

The ASLAN is new equipment and supports the communications between the DLAP and
the CMA.

CPDLC will supplement, but not replace systems presently in the NAS inventory.
This is a collocated facility generating no environmental staffing.

The Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) is a system based on commercial-off-
the-shelf (COTS) computers integrated through a LAN and distributed through a
WAN.  It hosts the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) used in the ARTCC.  CTAS
provides computer automation to enhance the arrival/departure throughput and
efficiency of air traffic operations in the extended terminal airspace
surrounding major airports.  The end users are Traffic Management Coordinators
(TMCs) and Air Traffic Controllers in the ARTCC.  The TMCs interact directly
with the system via monitors and input devices added into the Traffic
Management Unit (TMU) and may include a projector.  TMA calculates arrival
schedules in real time.  This is based on flight plan and track information
received from NAS components, including HOST Computer System (HCS) and ARTS, and
information entered by the TMCs and controllers.

TMA is connected to the CCCH through the HID/NAS LAN/HCS (HNL) and provides TMCs
with a tool to coordinate the arrival traffic flow by graphically depicting the
traffic demand and arrival schedules to the adapted airports.  Graphic displays
of arrival and delay information can be customized on the individual facility
and user basis.  When enabled by the TMC, this information is displayed by the
HCS in meter lists on the DSR consoles.  TMA is also connected to the ARTS at
the associated TRACON through the ARTS Data Interface (ADIF).  It is a one-way
data stream from ARTS for passing tracks and flight plans to TMA at the ARTCC.
The ADIF process at the ARTCC connects directly to a process on the ARTS Gateway
(AGW) at the TRACON called AGW TMA.  There is no separate CTAS hardware at the
TRACON for this process.  CTAS TMA consists of Cisco routers, multiple Sun ultra
Workstations, tape drives, other peripheral equipment and may include a
projector system.

The Center TRACON Automation System Remote Display (CTASR) is a subsystem of
CTAS, and consists of remote displays for TMA.  They are connected to the
associated system through a T1 communications line with a one-way data feed.
The purpose of the remote TMA display is to provide TMA data to associated
facilities as a traffic management advisory.  CTASR provides the ability for
Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) to be displayed at remote sites via a one-way
data feed.  This includes the Planview GUI and Timeline GUI.  Remote TMA
consists of non-redundant Sun Ultra computers with monitors and may include a
projector.  A Hub is used when more than one display is installed at the remote
site.  Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units are included to provide backup
power if the system is not attached to critical power.  Data is distributed
from the associated TMA at the ARTCC externally through the use of routers and
Channel Service Unit/Data Service Units (CSU/DSU).  The remote TMA display is
controlled remotely through the Monitor & Control (M&C) computers at the
associated TMA at the ARTCC.  Remote TMA displays may be located at either a
TRACON, terminal or adjacent ARTCC environment.

Digital Altimeter Setting Indicator Replacement

This program acquired commercially available indicators that display
atmospheric pressure in a digital format.  It replaced 175 obsolete
indicators from several different vendors with units manufactured by a
single vendor.  Procurement of an additional 300 units is planned in
2000.  When this project is completed, all FAA DASI systems will be
from a single manufacturer, greatly simplifying logistics support,
maintenance, and training.

The DC Battery Backup System (DCBUS) is used to provide 24 volts of Direct
Current (DC) prime power to equipment and systems.  It also provides 190 DC
amperes of battery backup power at 24 volts to the critical load for a minimum
of 4 hours or more dependent upon current load.  The DCBUS consists of batteries
(deep large cell type) and dual rectifiers/chargers.  The number of batteries
is dependent upon the specified time requirements for DC power, typically 12
cells, 2 volts each, with a rating of 880 Ampere Hours (AH).  The system also
includes two inverters to provide Alternating Current (AC) power to TELCO Grim
(CSTI) and test equipment.  Facility code 8361, class A, is to be used for all
regionally purchased DCBUS systems.
-
The Marconi DCBUS, facility code 8362, is used to provide 24 volts, 200 Amps of
prime power to communications equipment (transmitters, receivers, etc.) and
consists of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries and dual
rectifiers/chargers.  The typical battery bank consists of 12 or 36 batteries
of 2 volts each, ranging in capacity from 530 to 2100 Ampere Hours (AH).  In
some cases, there may be 2 battery banks, consisting of 12 batteries each,
resulting in 24 batteries.  The battery is the lowest replaceable and
serviceable unit in the battery bank.  The battery bank is sized to provide
4-72 hours of backup power to the facility's DC loads.  The Marconi DCBUS
system will have batteries sized to provide 72 hours of backup power.  The
system also includes two inverters to provide Alternating Current (AC) power to
associated telecommunications equipment and test equipment.
-
Facility code 8362, Marconi DCBUS, are primarily installed at RCAGs, RTRs,
BUECs, and small Air Traffic Control Towers that do not have engine generator
backup.
-
The DCBUS also has a remote maintenance monitoring and control package that can
interface with Environmental Remote Monitoring Subsystem (ERMS).
-
This facility may also replace a small standby engine generator system where
authorized by a Regional Operations Manager.

A data multiplexer, such as the Paradyne modem, enabling a number of independent
data transmission requirements to be consolidated in a single transmission
channel whose speed equals the sum of the input channels.  The data-multiplexing
network (DMN) uses this technology to interconnect many FAA facilities, provid-
ing multiple data transmission paths with a minimum number of discrete channels.
This equipment consist of modems, multiplexers, automated network management
system (ANMS), clock boxes, channel service units/data service units (CSU/DSU),
and various ancillary equipment including digital A/B switches, port sharing
devices, modem sharing devices, hot standby switches, patch panels.  The ANMS's
will be located at centers only providing real-time monitoring, redundant paths,
and automatic switching capabilities.  Each modem is considered a unit.  This
facility covers all modems not otherwise captured as part of another facility.
This is a collocated facility having no environmental staffing.

The Display System Replacement (DSR) provides enhanced display management and
continuous operation while operating in an open system environment.  It also
provides hardware and software that will accommodate enhancements such as
weather and radar processor (WARP), ARTCC/TRACON automation system (CTAS) and
data link.  The DSR replaced system and display equipment such as computer
display channel (CDC), display channel complex rehost (DCCR), plan view display
(PVD), computer update equipment (CUE), and flight strip printers.  DSR also
replaced radar display systems (RDS) in ARTCCs in the contiguous United States
and Alaska, and oceanic sites (offshore and DOD sites).
-
All DSR equipment, including consoles used in the DYSIM, monitor and control,
and oceanic area are incorporated in the staffing values.  Class structure was
developed on the basis that three (3) consoles (normally one 'R' console, one
'D' console and one 'A' console) are equal to a suite.  However, any other
three-console configurations will qualify as a suite.  Therefore, total DSR
consoles, regardless of their application, at a location divided by 3 equals
the number of suites.

This is a collocated facility and does not generate environmental staffing.

The En Route Communications Gateway (ECG) is a data interface for the Host
Computer System (CCCH) and Direct Access Radar Channel (DARC) processors for
surveillance and communication interfaces currently provided by the Peripheral
Adapter Modular Replacement (PAMRI).  ECG provides network interfaces and
protocols for future networks compatible systems, while continuing to support
point-to-point interfaces and protocols to legacy automation systems.  To
achieve the versatility required to migrate from legacy to new interfaces, the
ECG will incorporate multiple protocol processing.
-
ECG provides two Prime Interface Processors (PIPs) to replace the PAMRI Adapter
Units and two Backup Interface Processors (BIPs) to replace the PAMRI Radar Data
Distribution Units.  The ECG contains separate data paths for the CCCH (Prime)
and DARC (Backup).  Both the Prime and Backup data paths provide redundancy in


The Environmental Remote Monitoring Subsystem (ERMS) is a fully functioning,
standalone, remote monitoring subsystem, performing within the remote mainten-
ance monitoring subsystem (RMMS).  The primary function of ERMS is to perform
Remote Maintenance Monitoring (RMM) at remote sites of the environmental
parameters not monitored by the electronic equipment's embedded RMS.

ERMS shall gather, process, and send data from the various environmental
systems at a facility to the Maintenance Processor Subsystem (MPS) or the NAS
Infrastructure Management System (NIMS).  ERMS will generate and automatically
send alarm messages to the MPS/NIMS on an event-driven basis that will allow
the Maintenance Control Center (MCC) or Operational Control Center (OCC)
specialists to query for equipment status and initiate control commands.  ERMS
is a microprocessor-based cell controller having four data communications
interfaces, sensors, a sensor power supply, and an uninterruptible power
supply.  The four interfaces include the MPS, portable maintenance data
terminal (PMDT), sensors, and the remote sensor.  ERMS is the processor that
provides the interface between the MPS/NIMS and the individual environmental
systems.  These environmental systems are monitored by ERMS either via
individual data point sensors installed on the equipment or an RS-232 port
directly connected to equipment's internal monitoring system.  Environmental
systems that are themselves monitoring systems, such as fuel tank monitors,
fire/smoke detectors, are not ERMS, but are defined as sensors that are
connected to and monitored by the ERMS.  Staffing values for this facility
include environmental support workload.

Flight Service Display System (FSDS) provides the AFSSs with visual display of
air traffic control (ATC) and weather information to further enhance services
and improve the quality of the in-flight services and advisories provided to
civilian airspace users.
-
The FSDS [SUA/ISE (Special Use Airspace / Inflight Service Enhancement)] is an
automated system which graphically displays NOWRAD (weather radar) data every
15 minutes, depicts SUA schedule data activity received from the SUA Management
System (SAMS), displays dynamic Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) aircraft position
and flight plan information, and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) aircraft position,
and provides depiction of those assigned discrete beacon codes by the ATC for
flight following services with the National Airspace System (NAS).  The SUA/ISE
platform receives all dynamic aircraft position and flight plan data information
from the Traffic Management System (TMS).  SUA/ISE also graphically displays
all navigational aids (NAVAID), airports, vector airways and jet routes in the
continental U.S.  SUA/ISE is a standalone system that does not interface with
OASIS but will be integrated in the OASIS console.  The SUA/ISE suite consists
of a single equipment rack and SUA/ISE Sun workstation in the equipment room
and from two to seven Sun workstation in the AFSS floor.

The FSS encompasses the flight advisory system communications utilized for
providing airport and enroute advisories, pilot briefings, weather observations,
flight plan handling services, point-to-point telecommunications with pilots
over international territories or waters, flight plan following, search and
rescue action, and other flight assistance operations.  This is all the equip-
ment from the controller's headset to and including FAA's demarc.  It includes
emergency backup transceivers, all four channel equipment, tone channeling,
amplifiers, tie lines, regulators, power supplies and associated jacks, and jack
fields needed to send and receive communications from a local or remote comm-
unications facility. Maintenance transceivers are captured under the MCT
facility alpha.  An RCO facility (with suffix Z added to the location identi-
fier) should be established in the FSEP to capture workload for all trans-
mitters, receivers, and teletype equipment located in the equipment room.
Environmental staffing workload will be point-counted against ATBM.  This is a
core facility with staffing values determined by the number of radio positions.
Classes H-P and X-4 are added for facilities formerly classified as an IFSS.
Classes Q-4 should also establish an ICSS facility in the FSEP to capture the
remaining workload transferred to that facility.

The Ground Based Transceiver (GBT) is the remote, ground-based component of the
overall ADS-B system.  It provides a means for datalink communication between
compatibly equipped aircraft and the ARTCC.  Avionics onboard the aircraft
transmits position and vector information to the GBT, and the GBT communicates
the aircraft data via communications link to the network equipment located at
the ARTCC.  Track data can then be processed by the MEART for presentation on
controller displays, augmenting radar track data.  Conversely, radar track data
can be communicated from the MEART to the GBTs for transmission to the aircraft
and display of Traffic Information Services (TIS) data on graphical cockpit
displays.  GBT is also capable of transmitting Flight Information Services (FIS)
data to the aircraft for display of weather, NOTAMS, and other flight infor-
mation in the cockpit.
-
The GBT consists of a rack-mounted transceiver, rack-mounted power supply, GPS
antenna, UHF antenna, antenna cables, antenna surge suppression box, and comm-
unications link equipment as necessary for remote connection to the MEART.

The GWDS is a system comprised of a modular expandable configuration which
processes real-time weather transactions to generate and distribute FAA pre-
defined graphic products to flight specialist briefing positions.  Each user
position contains a color display.  An editor position, per facility, will allow
modification or enhancements to existing weather graphics products as well as
creation of special interest weather graphics for local usage by the flight
specialist.  The configuration contains all the essential hardware, software,
and communications for weather graphic product access.  This system replaces the
CCTV facility classes utilized for weather product informational purposes.  It
is collocated with AFSS Model 1 full capacity equipment in the flight service
facility and does not generate environmental staffing.  Classes A through F are
for flight service type facilities with some compliment of all system compo-
nents; i.e., editor, printer, etc. Classes G, H, J, and K are for facilities not
having all system component representation.  This is a collocated facility


The Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) provides a low-level wind shear
alert warning for use by air traffic controllers in a terminal ATC environment.
It consists of a center field sensor and one or more wind shear sensors
installed at strategic positions on or adjacent to an airport using telemetering
connection to a digital processor with ancillary visual and audible warning
indicators in the central operations facility.
-
The LLWAS-RS system (fac codes 47KA and 47KB) consists of a Master Station,
usually located at the base of the ATCT, that communicates by radio with 6 to 32
Remote Stations which use sonic anemometers to measure wind speed and direction.
LLWAS-RS information is displayed both in the ATCT and the TRACON at the ground
controllers positions.
-
LLWAS-RS measures wind speed and direction at its remote stations located on and
around the airport, computes whether hazardous wind shear or microbursts are
present, and displays runway-specific, hazardous weather status to air traffic
controllers who in turn relay advisories to pilots.
-
Staffing values include environmental support.

A radio beacon located at the ILS outer marker site, used primarily for ILS
approaches, which transmits a continuous carrier, L/MF radio wave in an omni-
directional pattern, enabling the pilot of an aircraft equipped with a radio
direction finder to determine his bearing relative to the outer marker.  All
radio beacons, regardless of output power, that are located or used as above,
will be treated as compass locators.  Staffing values include environmental
support for antenna structures.  Engine generator workload is identified by
power source code. (See Order 6000.5).

Low Power Tacan Antenna

This program acquires and replaces existing TACAN antennas with new,
low-power antennas.  The new antennas reduce input power requirements
from 5000 watts to 400 watts while maintaining the same radio frequency
power output.  This eliminates the need for backup diesel engine
generators at TACAN sites.

This is a Loran-C monitor facility, which is either collocated with a VHF omni-
directional range (VOR) or airport facility.  The VOR facility monitors the
integrity of the Loran-C transmitter station signals to provide air traffic
personnel with system operational status prior to issuing clearance for a
Loran-C non-precision instrument approach and provides calibration data for
Loran-C approaches.  The airport facility operates as a primary chain monitor
system (PCMS) which monitors additional parameters beyond those of the VOR
facility.  The PCMS monitors the entire LORAN chain of facilities to provide
status of adequacy for navigational use.  Typically, the VOR monitor is FAA
owned and maintained while the airport PCMS facilities are USCG owned and FAA
maintained.  Classes A and C staffing values do not include environmental
maintenance while class B does.

Long Range Radar Program

The FAA is replacing the majority of joint-use surveillance system
radars with Air Route Surveillance Radar, Model 4's (ARSR-4).  The FAA
is also preparing to deactivate its inventory of long-range radars
(these are not joint-use radars) once NEXRAD weather products are made
available to the air traffic controllers (mid CY 2000).  Current FAA
thinking is that the need for primary en route radars is drawing to an
end.  The majority of these existing radars have exceeded their planned
life-cycle by as much as 25 years.

The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and
ground-air-ground data link system designed to replace the aging Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon Systems (ATCRBS) and thus is being phased in over an
extended transition period.  Mode S can operate as a standalone system or in
conjunction with terminal or digitized en route radars and provide radar-
reinforced beacon reports.
-
There are a number of ASR-7 and ASR-8 terminal sites where there is no recon-
stituted beacon video available.  When deployed as part of the Mode S, the
Beacon Video Reconstitutor (BVR) provides displayable or reconstituted video of
Mode S beacon targets at ARTS-II sites with either ASR-7 or ASR-8 primary radar
that do not have the Remote Surveillance and Communications Interface Processor
(RSCIP) needed for full Mode S display functionality and optimization.

The Operations Control Center (OCC) provides for 24 hour-a-day operations
control with a focus on ensuring NAS infrastructure service delivery and
providing day-to-day tactical management of infrastructure services.   Each OCC
domain will encompass approximately one-third of the contiguous United States
with support provided to the offshore areas of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
Within these geographical service areas, OCCs are responsible for all NAS
service and system disciplines (e.g., surveillance, communications, navigation,
telecommunications, etc).

The OCC will coordinate and manage all NAS operations, maintenance, and
restoration activities within its assigned domain.  The OCC will monitor status
of assigned services and systems, diagnose problems, perform corrective actions
and/or coordinate the restoration of interrupted services/systems.  The OCC will
operationally reconfigure services/systems to minimize interruptions and enhance
service predictability.  As resources exist, the OCC will certify assigned
services and systems through use of the remote capabilities provided by the
National Infrastructure Management System (NIMS).

The National Operations Control Center (NOCC) manages and oversees the tactical
delivery of NAS infrastructure services from a national perspective by providing
24 hours a day, 7 days a week monitoring of the NAS infrastructure.  The NOCC
tracks AF activities in response to major events, monitoring and assessing
restoration activities for services that have widespread or highly visible
impact on NAS operations.  The NOCC reports significant infrastructure events to
FAA Executive Management.  As appropriate, the NOCC identifies and coordinates
courses of action to minimize the operational impact of faults or failures that
have widespread impact on NAS infrastructure services, and coordinates the
allocation of O&M resources from a national perspective.  The NOCC uses its own
and other control center service management products to centrally plan daily
work and future NAS infrastructure services delivery and management strategy.

The Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) is a simple visual aid to assist
pilots during their approach to landing.  It enables pilots to acquire the
correct glide slope and subsequently to maintain their position on it, thus
ensuring an accurate approach and landing.  The PAPI system consists of four
sharp transition projector units located at the side of the runway spaced
laterally +/- 30 foot intervals.  A second complementary set is sometimes
provided on the opposite side of the runway.  The setting angles of the
red/white interfaces of the four units are graded; the differences in angle
between the units being typically 20 minutes of arc.  The nominal glide slope
is midway between the angular settings of the center pair of units and the
on-glide-slope signal and is thus two red and two white lights in the bar.
If the aircraft goes below the glide slope, the pilot will see a progressively
increasing number of red lights.  Conversely, if the aircraft goes above the
glide slope, the number of white lights seen is increased.

RCAG includes Buoy Comm System (BCS) & VERN

This is a remote air/ground communications facility having transmitters and/or
receivers and ancillary equipment serving a center.  One channel of center
air/ground communications equipment employs one control line and associated
equipment needed to modulate, shift to standby equipment, or shut down the
channel and associated RF transmitters and receivers.  A split channel is one
in which separate control lines and associated equipment are used for each
frequency.  Each split portion becomes one channel.  Where two centers are
served, two RCAG's will be entered in the FSEP.  An RCAG collocated with a
center will be treated as a separate facility and not as part of the center
(add suffix Z to the location identifier of the collocated RCAG).  Solid-state
model codes shall be used when more than 50 percent solidstate transmitters/
receivers are installed.

The Buoy Communications System (BCS) RCAG consists of dual VHF transmitters and
receivers, voice switch interface equipment and dual power source equipment
installed in a 12 meter floating buoy.  It is designed for use in distant
offshore areas to extend shore based radio communications beyond line of sight
restrictions.  The system uses satellite communications between the shore and
the buoy to relay real time communications to and from the VHF radio located in
the buoy.  Those radios then forward real time communications to and from
aircraft operating in distant offshore areas.

Primary power for the buoy is from photovoltaic arrays that charge storage
batteries.  Diesel engine generator provides back-up power.

The VHF Extended Range Network (VERN) is an en route communication facility
using VHF voice radio transmitters, receivers, and associated control equipment.
It provides VHF communication coverage in designated areas from land-based
(coastal) sites and links those sites to Houston ARTCC.  VERN consists of
Wulfsberg Inc. Model WT-100 transmitter and WR-100 receiver.

Environmental staffing values are included for classes A-H and S (standalone),
but not for classes J-R (collocated).

Engine generator staffing values are determined by the power source code (see
Order 6000.5).  Emergency backup transceivers are captured under the BUEC
facility alpha.  Maintenance transceivers are captured under the MCT facility
alpha.


A remoted or peripheral facility providing radio communication services between
flight advisory specialists at flight service facilities and aircraft pilots.
If the equipment installed in one building serves both flight service facilities
and primary ATC central operations facility, there should be an entry in the
FSEP for each type operation served; i.e., RTR, RCAG, or BUEC and RCO.  See
definition for RTR, BUEC, and RCAG.  A transmitter, a receiver, or linear
amplifiers each count one unit.  An RCO, with suffix Z added to its location
identifier, should be established for radio communications equipment; i.e.,
transmitters, receivers, etc., located in the flight service facility equipment
room.  Emergency backup transceivers are excluded and are captured under the FSS
or BUEC facilities.  Maintenance transceivers are captured under the MCT
facility.  EOF's will be listed as EOF and not as RCO.

Staffing values include environmental support when it is a stand-alone or
primary facility only (Classes A through K and O and 1).  RCO's when collocated,
and not the primary facility, will not capture the environmental workload.
Classes P - Z and 2 do not include environmental staffing.


Tower Controller Workstation (TCW) and Remote Controller Workstation Display
(RCW) provide a high brightness display of ATC radar service and weather data
in conjunction with MEART facility type operations to a tower collocated with
the ARTCC/CERAP.  It is attached to the MEART via a LAN.  Each TCW consists of
21 high brightness LCD monitor, Ultra 10 Sun Processor, MEART backlit keyboard,
3-button trackball, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and harmonic distortion
filter.  The Remote Controller Workstation (RCW) provides the same data as the
TCW in conjunction with MEART facility type operations at a remote tower.  The
RCW is connected to the MEART via dedicated landlines or radio communications
link (RCL).  The RCW contains the same hardware as the TCW.  In addition, a
third LAN interface is provided to interface to a CISCO 1005 router.  The
router is connected to the transmission path via a modem attached to the router
serial port.  Each RCW is driven via dual RDIPs from the ARTCC/CERAP.  If
multiple displays are utilized at a tower then 10base-T hubs are provided to
create a local LAN at the tower otherwise the display connects directly to
the router.

The Remote Transmitter/Receiver (RTR) is an air-to-ground communications system
having transmitters and/or receivers and ancillary equipment serving a terminal
facility.  A transmitter, a receiver, or a linear amplifier each count as one
unit.

If the equipment installed in one building serves more than one terminal
communications facility at that airport location, only one RTR shall be entered
in FSEP; if one is off the airport, then two RTR facilities will be captured in
FSEP; if equipment is collocated that serves a flight service facility, an RCO
should also be listed in FSEP; or if equipment is collocated which serves a
center, an RCAG should also be shown in FSEP.  An RTR facility, with suffix Z
added to the location identifier, should be established in the FSEP to capture
all transmitters, receivers, etc., installed in the tower equipment room.
Emergency backup transceivers are excluded and are captured under the ATCT
facility.  Maintenance transceivers are captured under the MCT facility.

Staffing values include environmental workload when it is a standalone or
primary facility (Classes A through N, P, X, and O).  When collocated and not
the primary facility, the primary facility will capture the environmental
workload (Classes Q through 7).  Engine generator workload is identified by
power source code.  (See Order 6000.5.)

The Runway Visual Range (RVR) system measures the atmospheric transmissivity
along runways and translates this value to the air traffic user.  The legacy
systems consist of a light beam projector and a receiver located at a measured
distance from the projector.  Variation in light beam intensity, runway edge
light setting, and ambient light conditions are converted to visibility values
and telemetered to the terminal central operations facility for use by ATC
personnel controlling traffic.

The Teledyne systems derives the runway visibility values using runway edge
light setting, ambient light condition and an infrared light emitting diode
with infrared detector to measure the scattering coefficient of light in the
atmosphere.  A maximum of 18 sensors can be associated per Data Processor Unit
(DPU).  If two or more DPU's are installed, a separate facility per DPU shall

The Surface Movement Advisor (SMA) NASA prototype is an information
gathering/sharing tool developed by the FAA and NASA.  Its primary function is
to reduce departure ground delays by sharing real-time scheduled information to
decision makers so that surface operations can be optimized.  It provides
enhanced runway balancing by ATC and facilitates better ramp/gate management by
airlines and ramp towers.  Additionally it provides real-time and schedule data
on both arrivals and departures to the airport authority for runway and taxiway
repairs.  Data is delivered to workstations and presented to user displays in
the FAA tower, the airline operations control centers, ramp towers and the
airport authority.
-
The SMA Core Capability Limited Deployment (CCLD) provides airline operation
centers (AOCs) and airport ramp tower personnel with a one-way feed of Automated
Radar Terminal System (ARTS III) data so that they have real-time and predicted
knowledge of aircraft arrival information.  This information will include
aircraft identification; aircraft position in TRACON airspace, and could be used
to compute estimated touchdown time.  This data will allow users to better
coordinate ground support operations, allocating resources such as ramp and
airport services in a more efficient manner.
-
The SMA NASA prototype configuration comprises of a series of inter-networked
systems located at the Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.  The major
components are:  2 Silicon Graphics Inc. servers, 4 Silicon Graphics work-
stations, a CISCO 700 router and a series of Ethernet sub LANs.  There are also
10 display terminals located throughout the ramp and ATC towers.

This facility combines multiple low-speed asynchronous channels (each of which
is typically transmitting data only a fraction of the time) into a synchronous
channel whose speed may be significantly lower than the sum of the asynchronous
channel speeds.  Short term buffering and dynamic bandwidth allocation make this
possible.  The STATMUX network supports the CBI, TMS, and MMS operational re-
quirements.  This is a collocated facility having no allowance for environmental
workload.


The Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) is designed to
replace the existing FAA and DOD automated radar terminal system (ARTS) at
TRACONs.  STARS is a scaleable system designed to meet the terminal automation
needs of ATC facilities ranging from the smallest standalone approach control
facility to the largest metroplex control facility.  It is a fully digital
system capable of tracking all aircraft within a defined space using available
FAA/DOD surveillance systems that provide digitized sensor data.

STARS will be phased in and run parallel with the existing ARTS equipment that
will eventually be phased out.  STARS is based on the modification of several
existing Non-Developmental Item (NDI) software products and the maximum use of
mainstream Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) hardware and Commercial Available
Software (CAS).  The existing NDI software products include Raytheon's AutoTrac
automation system and Hughes Aircraft Company TracView automation system.  CAS
includes UFA's ATCoach test and training simulation software.  These software
products are combined with other CAS products such as Sun Solaris Unix Operating
System and Sensis MultiScan Correlation software to form a modern open systems
architecture for an air traffic control automation system that can be easily
maintained and enhanced.  The EDC-2 configuration provides STARS color displays
integrated with both STARS and ARTS backroom equipment.

The FS-2+ configuration replaces the ARTS equipment and can accommodate 16
radars, up to 128 consoles, up to 20 remote towers and 8 ARTCC interfaces.

STARS equipment consists of AS1, AS2, Comm, OPS1, AIA and LT racks; emergency
service lan (ESL); full service lan (FSL); data recording facility (DRF);
monitor and control workstation (MCW); and terminal controller workstations
(TCW).

STARS LITE, facility code 02FW, utilizes STARS as its foundation.  It is
designed for use at stand-alone General Aviation airport control towers that
have radar coverage at traffic pattern altitude from one or more off-site
radar(s) associated with TRACON or ARTCC facilities.  It is a compact, low-cost
system that utilizes a single Sun Microsystems processor and provides a color
flat panel ATC display presentation to improve the tower controller's
situational awareness.  STARS LITE consists of a single Sun Microsystems
processor and one to three NEC color tower displays.  This is a collocated
facility and does not generate environmental staffing.

The Tower Data Link Services (TDLS) Phase 1 data link processor will provide
sub-network, independent message routing between application processors and
associated end-to-end communication functions supporting Flight Data Input/
Output (FDIO) and Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC).  It provides for no data link
message capability and requires the airport tower personnel to manually record
the ATIS message.  The recorded message is then broadcast on VHF for monitoring
by aircraft.  Phase 2 provides the D-ATIS with automatic voice generation (AVG).
Using the D-ATIS application, the controller is able to generate ATIS messages
that are broadcast to pilots via data link or by voice.  The ATIS voice message
is created automatically through a voice synthesis unit.  The D-ATIS resides on
the TDLS platform and provides generation of the ATIS test message (ATM) and
ATIS voice message (AVM) for delivery to the D-ATIS database and the ATIS VHF
transmitter, respectively.  TDLS2 is a technical refresh project to enable
replacement of the obsolete TDLS platform hardware and software for continued
and improved service availability.  It also ensures an efficient and effective
transition from CMLS to FAA maintenance.  TDLS2 backroom equipment is comprised
of a 24" rack with two Dell PowerEdge 1400 PCs, a 15" Dell monitor, keyboard
with built-in trackball, a KVM switch, VSUs and an UPS.  There are also 2X

This facility provides staffing values for FAA access roads used for vehicular
travel.  Normal roads of less than 1/2 mile, used for access to most facilities,
should not be entered in the FSEP as a TR but are included in the primary
facility served; i.e., environmental.  This is a support-type facility in the
multiple unit category as described in paragraph 24i(2), with staffing allocated
per mile, rounding off fractions to the nearest whole number; i.e., 0.5 to 1.49
miles = 1 unit; 1.5 to 2.49 miles = 2 units, etc.

This facility type identifies locations where the ARTS and the IFR room are not
located in or adjacent to the tower base building and/or facilities without ARTS
or RBDPE regardless of IFR room location.  This facility will only be authorized
under these conditions.  An RTR with suffix Z in the location identifier will be
established to capture the workload for all transmitters, receivers, etc., that
are located in the equipment room.  Emergency backup transceivers will be cap-
tured under this facility.  Maintenance transceivers will be captured under the
MCT facility alpha.  All other electronic equipment, not identified as another
facility type, will be point-counted against TRACO for class determination.
Environmental staffing values will be point-counted against ATBM or TOWB depen-
dent upon configuration and location relative to the tower base building.
Engine generator staffing values will be identified by power source code. (See
Order 6000.5.)  A TRACO FSEP entry will be added for TRACONs collocated with
ATCT's.  These entries must carry a "Z" suffix on the location identifier.  No
staffing allowance will be granted for these entries as they are for tracking
purposes only.

are only four designated "Large TRACONs".  Those are: Southern California,
Elgin, New York, Northern California, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Atlanta.  There
will eventually be additional designations -Denver and Orlando.  Any facility
code/class changes to reflect these should be placed in the PFF.

The TRVSS has been designed to switch and distribute the terminal radar signals
from any number of common equipment (CE) assemblies/surveillance and communi-
cation interface processor (SCIP) to one or more display positions.  Each posi-
tion selects which of the radar data is to be delivered to a position.  The
TRVSS can accept radar data from an ASR-7, ASR-8, or an ASR-9 radar system.  The
TRVSS processes the signals necessary to support any display device that is
supported by the radar systems described.  Because of the differences in
existing hardware and facilities, each TRVSS will be configured expressly for a
particular FAA site.

The User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) system is an initial conflict probe
capability to be used as an advisory tool by the D-position controllers at
ARTCCs for strategic planning and clearance decision-making.  The URET system
receives its radar and non-radar data from the Host Computer System (CCCH) via
redundant Host Gateway (HGW) processors.  A primary and backup HGW is provided
for each of the two Hosts for the operational processing applications.  A third
HGW is provided to interface the Test and Training equipment to the Host.  URET
communicates with DSR through three Display System Gateway (DSGW) processors.
Two DS Gateways connect the URET ARTCC operational configuration with the LCN
Central Access Ring Set.  A third DS Gateway connects the T&T configuration to
the ARTCC T&T Access Ring Set.  URET Core Capability Limited Deployment (CCLD)
backroom equipment consists of five equipment racks 79" high, 24" wide,
36" deep that will contain Sun processors, Cisco concentrators and a Cisco
router.  The control room equipment will consist of a 20-inch flat panel monitor
with articulating arm, trackball and a modified strip bay configuration in each
D-position console.

URET backroom equipment consists of eight equipment racks containing Sun
processors (F280R and V1280), Cisco 4006 fast Ethernet switches a Cisco 3640
router, 4mm tape drive SUN DDS-4, Excerta 3480 tape drive, tape library SUN L9,
disk arrary SUN D2, maintenance terminal and switch.  The control room equipment

An airport lighting facility in the terminal area navigation system used
primarily under VFR conditions, providing vertical guidance to aircraft during
approach and landing by radiating a directional pattern of high intensity red
and white focused light beams that indicate to the pilot that he is "on path" if
he sees red/white, "above path" if white/white, and "below path" if red/red.
Lamp brightness is changed to preset levels by the operator on manual systems
and by the system itself on automatic systems.  Classes A through E are landline
controlled.

This facility captures the air traffic control video compression system, which
uses advanced digital compression techniques for the transmission of DBRITE air
traffic control video from TRACON facilities to remote ATCTs over existing
narrow-band data links.  The VCS consists of a video compressor unit, which
interfaces directly to the video output of a DBRITE digital scan converter
cabinet and a video decompressor unit which interfaces directly with a DBRITE
tower display unit.  This is a digital system that digitizes, compresses and
sends full radar and beacon signals from the radar site to any display site.
This is a collocated facility and does not generate environmental staffing.

The Wind Equipment F-400 series (WEF) measures the wind speed by a measuring
instrument consisting of cups attached to the end of spokes extending
perpendicularly from a hub. The assembly is attached to the top end of a free
turning vertical shaft, the bottom of which is a permanent magnet dc generator.
Wind striking the cups causes the shaft of the dc generator to rotate.  The
speed at which it rotates is directly proportional to the wind speed.

The dc voltage produced is proportional to the wind speed and is converted to
wind speed in knots.  The WEF consists of a cup-rotor anemometer, spread tail
wind direction vane and speed and direction indictors. The retransmitter is a
test device that interrupts the field direction and speed and introduces fixed
values.  These fixed values appear on the indicators for testing system
accuracy.

The WAAS Master Station (WMS) is one of the subsystems that make up the Wide
Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  The WMS contains the equipment that processes
the data used in the generation of WAAS messages for use by aircraft equipped
with approved receivers.  The WMSs, in parallel for redundancy, independently
receive data from all WRSs. The WMSs perform the functions of correction
processing, satellite orbit determination, integrity determination,
verification, validation, and WAAS message generation.  By using the data from
all operational WRSs, the WMS determines satellite and Ionospheric Grid Point
(IGP) integrity, differential corrections, satellite orbits, and residual error
bounds for each monitored satellite and each IGP.  Integrity is maintained
through the use of a safety computer, which ensures a low probability that
hazardously misleading information will be broadcast to the users.  The safety
computer generates WAAS messages, adds Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) coding,
and sends the messages to the Geo Uplink System (GUSs) for subsequent uplink to
GEO satellites and retransmission to WAAS users.

Control of WAAS and coordination of maintenance activities is accomplished at
the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) subsystem located at the NOCC and the POCC.
Data from external agencies is received and processed by the Message Center
Processor (MCP).  Separate communication node cabinets provide redundant
communication lines between the WMS and all WRS and GUS.  Only one WMS contains
the controlling O&M subsystem at any given time.

The WMS cabinet houses two correction processors, a safety computer, an
Ethernet hub, a GPS clock, two 120 VAC power conditions, and an RF/DC transient
suppressor.  The comm node cabinet houses the Backbone Concentrator Node (BCN)
router, an Ethernet switch, a 208 VAC power conditioner, and an isolation
transformer.  Blower assemblies circulate cool air in each cabinet.

The Weather System Processor (WSP) is used primarily to produce timely alerts of
hazardous weather conditions to Air Traffic Controller (ATC) personnel.  In
particular, it detects and reports two wind shear conditions, microbursts and
gust fronts that often endanger aircraft during landing and takeoff.  The WSP
also produces general storm motion tracking and prediction, and generation of
six-level, anomalous propagation (AP) free, precipitation maps in the terminal
area as an aid in the management of air traffic and ground facilities.  WSP
reports the position of wind shear hazards relative to the nearest Area Noted
for Attention (ARENA).  It also issues reports to Terminal Weather Information
for Pilots (TWIP).  The weather products are used by Air Traffic Controller
personnel and external users and displayed on Weather System Processor Work-

The Weather System Processor Remote Workstation (WSPRW) is a subsystem of the
Weather System Processor (WSP).  The WSPRW is a dedicated display used to
indicate and produce timely alerts of hazardous weather conditions to Air
Traffic Controller (ATC) personnel.  WSPRW displays and reports two wind shear
conditions, microbursts and gust fronts that often endanger aircraft during
landing and takeoff.  The WSPRW also displays general storm motion tracking and
prediction, and generation of six-level, anomalous propagation (AP) free,
precipitation maps in the terminal area as an aid in the management of air
traffic and ground facilities.  WSPRW indicates the position of wind shear
hazards relative to the nearest Area Noted for Attention (ARENA).  It also
issues reports to Terminal Weather Information for Pilots (TWIP).
-
At an ATCT collocated with a TRACON the WSPRW consists of a geographic situation
display (GSD), tape recorder, ribbon display terminal (RDT), and router in the
TRACON, and a GSD, router, and two RDTs in the tower.  Backroom equipment
consists of a workstation and 19" half size rack in the tower equipment room.
-
At an ATCT supported by a consolidated/remote TRACON, WSPRW consists of a GSD,
router, and two RDTs in the tower.  Backroom equipment consists of a workstation
and 19" half size rack in the tower equipment room.
-
At a consolidated TRACON, WSPW consists of the router/communications server, the
ethernet hub, the geographic situation display (GSD), and (RDT) normally
installed in the local TRACON.
-
This is a collocated multiple unit facility and generates no environmental
staffing.
