rpm.s - Version 1 Revision 7 - Replace()
Protection Macro - Written with TSE-PRO GUI
4.0. This macro protects text to the right of
a column block from being pulled into the
block when a replace text is shorter than the
find text in a Replace() operation. This is
for the specific instances where large
amounts of find text (typically spaces) are
removed using Replace(). Normally, when this
is done in a column block, the text outside
the block to the right is pulled into the
block as the reducing replacements take
place, and the pulled in text becomes part of
the find text and replacement is done there,
too. This macro is particularly beneficial
when doing columns of text or data, since a
properly marked column block will completely
protect all columns to the right of the block
from movement or change. See the Comments in
