SMTHSCRL -- Put this in your AutoLoad list 
to make the vertical scrollbar in TSE 
editing windows scroll proportional to how 
many pixels you move the mouse, rather than 
how many characters you move the mouse.  For 
TSE 2.6 and higher, both console and GUI 
versions.  See the enclosed SMTHSCRL.TXT for 
details.
