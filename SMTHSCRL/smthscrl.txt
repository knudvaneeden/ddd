SMTHSCRL -- Smooth scrolling scrollbar macro for TSE.


Description:

	SmthScrl only works on the 32-bit versions of TSE (v2.6 and higher); 
	it does not work on the DOS-based TSE 2.5 or lower.

	This macro gives you a pixel-based scrollbar when windowed.  When in 
	character mode, your scrollbar won't work anymore.  Hey, that's the 
	breaks.

	When windowed, you can click the little thumb tab on the vertical 
	scroll bar and drag it up and down, and the file will scroll a bit for 
	each pixel position you move the mouse.  It is significantly less 
	jerky than the default character-based scrollbar.

	Note that when scrolling with the scrollbar, the cursor line remains 
	on the same row.  This is because TSE doesn't allow the cursor line to 
	be scrolled out of visibility, so as an alternative it seems better to 
	leave the cursor line row unchanged.

	Put it in your AutoLoad list.


Known limitations:

	It doesn't work in full-screen character mode; the scrollbar is 
	disabled, and gets drawn funny if you try to use it.  There is 
	unfortunately nothing that can be done about that.

	SmthScrl totally overrides TSE's built-in scrollbar and draws a custom 
	scrollbar appearance.  When scrolling using the cursor keys TSE draws 
	the scrollbar, and then SmthScrl draws the custom appearance.  As a 
	side effect, the scrollbar flickers until you finish scrolling.


History:

	v1.2 -- July 24, 2004 -- Public release.
