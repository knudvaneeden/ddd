slide2.zip - TSE Pro - Updated by Lanny Finch
These Slide macros work by "grabbing" a line,
character, or block, and then causing that
item to move along with the cursor,
effectively "sliding" it around surrounding
text. Though simple, I'm sure if you get into
the habit of having this feature in your
editor, you'll be hooked for life. -Terry Cox
