<02-24-99> -  Emul_Win.ui  -  TSE Pro/32 v2.8
If you do your programming in TSE32 and have
to prepare your documentation in a Windows
word processor, you may find this user
interface useful.  It emulates the most
common Windows keys and some useful functions
found in Windows word processors.  The UI
manages to maintain all of the features found
in the standard TSE32 UI.  Repeat find
up/down is bound to the cursor up and down
keys. Not standard but very handy. Push Shift
F1 to view the key bindings. Incoporated also
is the TSE jr's "Open File At Cursor" macro,
patched to allow for blanks in the file name.
The most frequently used WordStar keys have
been left intact in case you need them.
(Actually it's because I wrote my first
serious code in WordStar 3.3's non-document
mode for a FORTRAN 77/dBASE II project
targeted at CPM-80.  Yeah I know ..."What's
CMP?")
