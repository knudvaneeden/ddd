	Video Routines for the Semware Editor by Rob Staveley
	---------------------------------------------------------

	Though it has always impressed me that TSE Jr. and latterly
	The Semware Editor support 132 & 100 column text modes, I
	have found it an irritation that you have to shell out to
	DOS and back in again to get them, if did not start your
	editing session in such a mode.

	However..

	I have just noticed (okay I am not the greatest R-er of T
	F-ing M) that TSE supports "binary" file includes, and
	pretty straight forward ones at that.

	Here goes:

		(1) Put VID.BIN into a directory called \TSE\ASM\
		    (optionally along with BIN.BAT and VID.ASM).

		(2) Put VID.S into \TSE\UI\.

		(3) Add an inclusion for VID.S in \TSE\UI\TSE.S.

			#include ["vid.s"]      // include VID.S

		(4) Add macro calls in you key definition file
		    \TSE\UI\TSE.KEY:

			<F12>		mHiMode()
			<Ctrl F12>	mPageFlip()

		    ..or whichever keys you find intuitive.

                (5) ** IMPORTANT **
                    Edit \TSE\UI\VID.S lines 46 and 47 to suit your
                    video adaptor. There are notes for this above those
                    lines in the file.

			HICOLS = 132,	/* Number of columns in high mode */
			HIMODE = 22h	/* High video mode */

		(6) Burn in the new configuration using SC.EXE eg:

			CD \TSE\UI
			SC -b..\E.EXE TSE

	..and Rob's your uncle.


	=========================================================
	Techies:

	The only real trick in all this is in line 64 of VID.S:

		Set(CurrVideoMode,_AUTO_DETECT_)

	The internal variables ScreenCols and ScreenRows are
	protected from poking, which means abusing the Set()
	command. I was even sensibly prevented from sending them
	as references, using the var keyword.

	It was a nice surprise to discover that _AUTO_DETECT_
	could be used with CurrVideoMode. This is undocumented,
	but let's face it, who in their right mind would want to
	do that!

	The BIN source is written for TASM (apologies,
	Microsofties).
