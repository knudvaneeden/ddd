Ocr_bl : Using a massive list of word pairs, it replaces consistenly badly scanned words with their correct counterparts without any interaction from the user. At the end, the macro generates a report, which can be consulted before the text file is saved. 2wrdlist: This is the macro to use, when the OCR software mixes up two words, that by themselves are perfectly correct. You add such word pairs to the 2wrdlist.wrd file, and let the macro search for occurrences of these words in the text file, giving the user the choice to easily swap each such word in the text file. Goodcase: OCR software can have a problem determining the case of some letters: this macro solves such mistaken cases, using the surrounding letters to determine the correct case.

The buildmac system makes my life a lot easier by pulling together the latest version of my macros from my live TSE macro directory, along with all the docs and support files for each package. It conveniently pulls all the package meta information (package name, version info, description, etc.) from the source file; then it puts all this in the docs and the FILE_ID.DIZ file.

My user interface file has lots of ExecMacro commands that reference them. And lots of those macros reference each other with ExecMacro commands. Whether these references were in the same case did not matter, because Windows is case-insensitive. Now there is a case-sensitive Linux TSE beta.   Oops!   Porting problem! This tool repairs ExecMacro commands in all opened files that contain an ExecMacro with a differently cased macro name than its disk filename. Linux-specific example: In a UI or macro file the command ExecMacro('Adjust') does not work if the macro's disk name is tse/mac/adjust.s . With this macro you can repair one or all ui and macro files in one go, check its report and unsaved changed files first, and if you are satisfied with the result, then you can save them all and e.g. use the Recompile macro to recompile them all. v1.0.1 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

For Windows it makes TSE show a file's path as it is cased on disk. For example, in Windows TSE has no problem opening "tse\MAC\adjust.s", but by itself it would keep showing "MAC" in upper case. Its first Linux feature allows you to case-insensitively open a specific folder or file. Its second Linux feature adds, that if you renamed only a file's case in the editor, then upon saving it to disk the disk file is renamed too, just like in Windows.

Cobol versions up to and including Cobol-85 indicate comments by putting an asterisk or a slash on column 7. Since version 3.0 TSE Pro supports this with to-end-of-line syntax hiliting if a configurable character is present at a configurable column. TSE Pro 2.8 users need this macro to do the same. For old versions of TSE (but >= 2.8), which do not have a Cobol syntax hiliting file yet, you can install one. Note: the macro can also be configured for syntax-hiliting Fortran comments.

chfiltim\chfiltim.mac;                                                    - ChFilTim.zip; 28 oct 2007 TSE Pro v3.0 upwards This macro changes the date/time of all files in a given directory and all its subdirectories by adding or subtracting an amount of time. It was originally written to make the files on a LAN server an hour older (by adding -1 hour) to solve a synchronization problem when the outside world was about to switch from summertime to wintertime. When the outside world switched from summertime to wintertime, and clocks went an hour back, then file-times on Windows pcs also went an hour back (*), but file-times on a LAN did not. So if files on Windows pcs were synchronized from a LAN-directory based on date/time, then the switch to wintertime suddenly made files on Windows pcs appear one hour older than the same files on a LAN, which inadvertenly triggered synchronization. (*) There are also advantages to this: A running Windows process does not see a just created file suddenly becoming an hour older or newer. Which for instance also means that a process cannot create files "in the future" :-) The macro prompts for: The directory. The type of time-unit: years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds. The positive or negative number of time-units to add. Whether to Simulate or Make the changes. DISCLAIMER! Use this macro at your own risk. It is not perfect. Always do a simulation first, and especially search the resulting report for "overflow", which means that a certain date/time will not be changed.

It does so by implementing some of the new TSE Pro v4.2 and TSE Pro v4.4 macro COMMANDS as macro PROCEDURES, and by using compiler directives to only use those macro procedures for the TSE versions that do not support the new macro commands yet, and to use the faster macro commands for the TSE versions that do support them. Additionally this file contains a group of compiler directives that make the compiler give a clear and specific message if someone compiles the macro with a TSE version before TSE Pro v4.0. Also it adds backwards compatible names for the component bits of the return value of QueryEditState(). TSE commands implemented as procedures:   -   Their procedure versions: integer proc isAutoLoaded() - 1.0 integer proc MkDir (string dir) - 1.0 integer proc RmDir (string dir) - 1.0 integer proc StartPgm (string pgm_name, string args, string start_dir, integer startup_flags) - 1.0 integer proc StrCount (string needle, string haystack) - 1.0 integer proc StrFind (string needle, string haystack, string options) - 1.0 integer proc StrFind5 (string needle, string haystack, string options, integer occurrence, var integer found_length) - 1.0 string proc StrReplace (string needle, string haystack, string replacer, string options) - 1.0 string proc VersionStr () - 1.1 Support procedures - Their procedure versions: integer proc compare_versions(string version1, string version2) - 2.0 integer proc wurn(string text) - 1.0 v1.7 Added StrCount(). v1.7.1 Bug fix: For Linux WIN32 should be defined, but as FALSE.

controlchars\controlchars.mac;                                            - ControlChars.zip; v1.0.1 31 Oct 2019 TSE Pro v4.0 upwards With this TSE extension you can better see control characters, like null, bell, backspace, tab, line feed, form feed, carriage return, and others. Better: Default the GUI version of TSE with an ANSI compatible font "hides" control characters by showing them as spaces. The Console version of TSE and e.g. the Terminal font show most control characters as regular characters, which is better but does not differentiate them from those regular characters. This TSE extension always shows all control characters and always makes them recognizable and distinguishable. Note, that in normal/non-binary mode TSE has stripped carriage returns and line feeds from lines, and what is not there will not be shown. Open a file in binary mode -3 (prefix opening a file with " -b-3 ") to see any carriage returns and line feeds too. In the TSE menu "ASCII Chart" you see control characters 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 31 also as the column "^@", "^A", "^B", "^C", ..., "^Z", ..., "^_". This TSE extension consistently shows a control character as the second character from that last column in the inverted text colour. This way you can always reference the ASCII Chart for the now visible control characters. v1.0.1 Improved the documentation.

This macro changes the color of the cursor position: if the background color equals the one configured for TSE's cursorline, and: either only when the cursor is not on a visible character, or always. The occasion for this macro was a user who uses a TSE color "intense ... ... on black" (which means a dark grey background): for this background color TSE does not show the cursor if the cursor position is a whitespace.
cursorline\cursorline.mac;                                                - CursorLine.zip; v1.0.4 14 Oct 2022 Windows TSE Pro GUI v4.2 upwards This extension brightens or dims all the cursor line's existing foreground or background colors by a configurable percentage. I use it to give the cursorline a subtle slightly different background color. This extension requires, that in TSE's editing colors configuration, the text cursorline color is the same as the text color, and that the block cursor line color is the same as the block color. Because TSE can be configured with light text on a dark background or dark text on a light background, the extension can brighten or dim both separately. It turns out that brightening and dimming foreground colors requires a large percentage to be visible, and brightening and dimming background colors requires only a tiny percentage. v1.0.3 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable. v1.0.4 Fixed a future problem: CursurLine now disables itself during _DISPLAY_HELP_ display mode, so it no longer overwrites OEM characters with ANSI characters there. Currently nobody edits files in _DISPLAY_HELP_ display mode, but in the future some of us will.

As this implies, the contents of inaccessible folders remain unlisted. v3.1 Groups the digits of file sizes. Now shows the correct size for files larger than 2,147,483,647 bytes for TSE versions from v4.40.95 upwards.

dontopen\dontopen.mac;                                                    - DontOpen.zip; v1.0 12 aug 2007 TSE Pro v3.0 upwards This macro protects you against (accidentally) opening unwanted files, like "*.bak" files, or like files in Subversion's "\.svn\" meta-directories, or whatever. Especially when you use TSE's -a and -s options and wildcards you can and want to open whole direcories or directory trees of files, but without those pesky exceptions. This macro notices it when you try to open such files, and asks your confirmation to NOT open them. You get one question for each File Open command that results in opening such files, and your answer applies to all files opened by that specific File Open command. You are asked the question only when the editor is otherwise idle, so that the macro does not interfere with other macros. For the same reason the macro internally works by letting TSE open the files, and then closing the unwanted ones. The macro works by matching the names of opened files against a TSE regular expression, and asks the user a question to confirm to not open the matching files. You can configure your own regular expression and question by executing the macro. The default configuration is for .bak and Subversion metafiles.

Note this distinction: For the names of folders, files and ADSes with non-ANSI characters use this Edit2 tool. For the content of files and ADSes with non-ANSI characters use the Unicode extension. An ADS is an optional, invisible, file-like attachment to a file or folder. There are a few command line tools that can show them. As far as I know Edit2 is the only file browser that does. An example of where an ADS occurs is, that when you download a file, for example "Edit2", your web browser will typically add an ADS to it, in this example a tiny text ADS called "Edit2:Zone.Identifier". An included example of a filename containing non-ANSI characters is "Edit2 - The a and ? of Tools.txt". Edit2 features: For its input and output it requires and default displays non-ANSI characters as their hexadecimal Unicode codepoint quoted with character 127 (usually a square). Luckily you can browse to such folders, files and ADSes, and the browser's current line is redisplayed above the list using the current font's full character range. As the tool's parameters you can enter a folder or file or ADS, optionally with non-ANSI characters or wildcards or preceded by the options "-a" (load all) or "-c" (configure) or "-d" (only ADSes) or "-f [filename]" (load files listed in file or current buffer) or "-s" (include subfolders). These options work much like they do for TSE's File Open command, but with the additional access to non-ANSI names and ADSes. Files and ADSes opened by Edit2 can be edited and saved.

TSE lets you open files without loading them, thus avoiding a memory limit. Contrary to TSE's own Find command, this macro can search across files only temporarily loading one file at a time, thus also avoiding a memory limit. The macro can also "Find and Do" to Keep or Abandon files containing a certain string: You can do this multiple times, thus step by step zeroing in on a smaller and smaller selection of opened files. v2.0.2 Improves the warning if too many files were opened. v2.01 Removed the dependency on global and macpar3. Added a pre-emptive check (including for regular expressions) to warn the user, that there is no use in searching for an empty string. Beta versions

I do not see a way forward, so I am abandoning this one. The intention was to show "best matches first" for a search string applied to the current file, BUT: Intentions turned out to be hard to catch in programming logic. I experimented with applying a weight to results, but this did not work satisfactory. Implementing intentions turned unavoidably into implementing my own biases, and worse, my current biases based on my current purposes. That made it impossible to make this a generic tool. For larger files it worked too slowly. I reduced the searched number of results, but that reduced the results. Sadness and pun intended.
elist\elist.mac;                                                          - eList.zip; v1.0.1 16 Jan 2019 TSE PRo v4.0 upwards This tool is included in TSE Pro v4.41.37a upwards. For older TSE versions down to TSE Pro v4.0 you can download it here. This tool is an alternative to TSE's built-in List() and lList() commands. As you type the list shrinks to those lines matching what you typed. It also works as a stand-alone macro or command to dynamically search the current file. In my humble opinion it is a more useful alternative to TSE's own incremental search functionality. What you type is interpreted as a TSE regular expression. v1.0.1 Solves the problem of how to supply a list title when using the macro as an include-file.
emulwin\emulwin.mac;                                                      - Emul_Win.ui - If you do your programming in TSE32 and have to prepare your documentation in a Windows word processor, you may find this user interface useful. It emulates the most common Windows keys and some useful functions found in Windows word processors. The UI manages to maintain all of the features found in the standard TSE32 UI. Repeat find up/down is bound to the cursor up and down keys. Not standard but very handy. Push Shift F1 to view the key bindings. Incoporated also is the TSE jr's "Open File At Cursor" macro, patched to allow for blanks in the file name. The most frequently used WordStar keys have been left intact in case you need them.

eoltype5\eoltype5.mac;                                                    - EolType5.zip; 1 apr 2007 NOTE THAT THERE IS A NEWER VERSION OF THIS MACRO ON THIS SAME PAGE! v5.1 (beta) of the EolType macro.       Compatibility:   TSE Pro 2.5e upwards. This OLD macro version is kept for OLD TSE versions. I downgraded this macro to beta status, because the 5.0 to 5.1 changes were not tested yet. Please report any reproducible errors you might find. Purpose: Save files with a unix/microsoft end-of-file-type based on configurable substrings that do/do not occur in the files' full filenames. Possibly handy when working with a Samba drive, Total Commander, WinSCP and other such tools. Version 5.1: Since the previously to SemWare's website released version was 1.0, the "new" features are: The substrings no longer have to start with a drive letter. Configuration file tse32\eoltype.dat became tse32\mac\eoltype.cfg. You can now configure what end-of-line-type warnings and questions you want when saving a file whose end-of-line-type is as configured being changed by the EolType macro.
eoltype\eoltype.mac;                                                      - EolType.zip; v7.1.1 17 Sep 2022 TSE PRo v4.0 upwards This is a TSE extension that enhances TSE's end of line type handling when editing non-Windows files with TSE. The EolType macro requires the Status macro to be installed. TSE itself already does a reasonable job of handling end of lines for those non-Windows files that: AND exist on disc, AND are not empty, AND have a correct end of line type. It does so implicitly: You do not know a file's end of line type. This macro fills the gaps: It also lets you CREATE non-Windows files, it adds the correct end of line type to files that were empty, it can be configured to repair files with the wrong end of line type, it lets you change a file's end of line type. It does so explicitly: Default it shows you everything concerning a file's end of line type. You might edit non-Windows files for instance: on a network drive that is mapped to a Unix, Linux or Mac machine. by using a remote-machine-browsing-tool like WinSCP or Total Commander, which you have configured to use TSE as its editor. when editing a file you downloaded from the internet. v7 Added understanding the newline characters in UTF-16 and UTF-32 files. v7.1 Added support for Linux TSE Beta v4.41.34 upwards. v7.1.1 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

eventlogger\eventlogger.mac;                                              - EventLogger.zip; v1.1.1 17 Sep 2022 Windows TSE v4 upwards,, Linux TSE v4.41.44 upwards This TSE extension logs selected TSE events to a file and/or to the screen. This helps macro programmers understand how TSE's hooks work. File logging is technically the best way, because it works fast and gives detailed timing information. You need to afterwards match your actions with the log entries. Visual logging to the title bar or the message line can be more problematical, because it can interfere with and be interfered by the editor. It can be really helpful though to see events as they happen in the context they happen in. It slows the editor a lot, because it pauses for you to read the logging. v1 There was a published beta-version. In this non-beta version hardcoded configuration constants were replaced by user-friendly configuration menus, all remaining TSE events were added, and you can now select which TSE events to log. v1.1 Now logs the editor's process id instead of Windows handle, because Linux TSE does not have a Windows handle, and now logs can be linked with other process id showing tools like Windows' Task Manager and Linux commands like top and ps. v1.1.1 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

For compilation errors it now provides a fancy error window with a pointer to the error (TSE v3 upwards). Breaking change: Removed the Dos command line capability. Fixed: Now also works if TSELOADDIR is set and the original load directory is not writable, perhaps because it is on a write-protected network drive.

findandgroupversionnamedfiles\findandgroupversionnamedfiles.mac;          - FindAndGroupVersionNamedFiles.zip; v2.0 21 Mar 2020 TSE Pro v4.0 upwards For a folder or for a space separated list of folders this tool creates a list of groups of those files, the names of which only differ by a version suffix in the name. This tool was requested by one user. I created it in the hope that it might have general benefits, but my conclusion is that it does not. In v2.0 the recognition of versions was rewritten. This was much improved, and is expected to function much better for its requested purpose and type of folders. That said, for general usage it functions slightly better but still poorly.
findaxlines\findaxlines.mac;                                              - FindaXlines.zip; v1.1 21 May 2022 TSE 4.0 upwards The tool's name stands for "Find across lines". It works like TSE's Find command, but with these differences: The search string can match a text string that spans across lines. Only the search options g, i, m, v, x, + and digits are used. When searching it sees each line end as a line feed character. In a regular expression "^" and "$" match a line end, "." now includes matching a line end, and "\s" matches any whitespace character (space, tab, line end, .). Default it matches a search range of at most 255 characters. In the search options you may specify a different search range, or "m" for the maximum range of 31,998 characters. Parameters can also be supplied as macro command line parameters. In the text it marks a found string as a block, and in a View Finds list it colors each found string. v1.0.1 Fixed a display bug in the View Finds list. v1.1 Made the documentation Potpourri-compliant, so you can easily Windows-copy/paste it to create a new Potpourri entry.

Concerning the problem (when running TSE Pro/32) of when a typed character is the "opposite" case of what the keyboard CAPSLOCK light indicates it should be: - If you are running WIN95 OSR2 or WIN98, AND CAPSLOCK is ON at the time you start-up a command prompt (which you then run e32.exe from) or you start the editor via a shortcut when CAPSLOCK is on, you will get this behavior in e32.exe (with these versions of the OS, MS introduced a bug into the API calls we access to read the keyboard). Note that if CAPSLOCK is OFF BEFORE you start the command line session or activate the shortcut, all will work fine and as expected. without needing this macro. See the read.me file for instructions.

Here whitespace-insensitive means that any non-empty string of consecutive whitespace-characters matches any other such string. Here the whitespace characters are space, horizontal tab, and formfeed. FndDubLn ignores characters past column 255. v1.0.1 Fixed: The macro could not handle empty lines, resulting in erroneous reports. The macro now ignores empty lines and lines containing only whitespaces.

For older TSE versions down to TSE Pro v4.0 you can download it here. When reopening a file this TSE extension restores the file's previous cursor position. A regular file is remembered based on its full path and file name. A temporary file is remembered just based on its file name. This makes it work with tools, that give access to a file outside the local file system by copying the file to an each time differently named temporary subfolder and then call the editor. The macro is an expanded version of the former TmpState macro, that only remembered cursor positions for temporary files. If you previously installed the TmpState macro, then you are advised to uninstall it in favour of this macro. v1.4.3 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

Here tab size means how many SPACE and TAB characters are the most consistently used to increase the indentation of a next line. A TAB character is treated as one SPACE character. For testing you can run it interactively to create a report of found tab sizes and the determined tab size. It also comes with a GetTabSize_Test tool, which tests and demonstrates GetTabSize by listing the tab sizes for all text files in a folder, defaulting to your TSE folder.

Because it uses a Windows function it has the same limits as Windows in recognizing drive types. My personal pet peeve is that Windows sees my harddisks and USB drives (not sticks) as the same drive type. A get_drive_type_test macro is provided to test and demonstrate get_drive_type()'s use. It lists all your drives and their type.

It requires that git is pre-installed on the computer and that the Status macro is pre-installed in TSE. If the current file is in a git directory, then the its git status is shown on the right-hand side of the screen. In Windows right-clicking the status (or in any OS executing the Git macro) pops up a menu, from which you can do explicit commits and list and open old versions of the current file. You can configure the extension to automatically do a "git add" or "git add+commit" after each file save. v1.4 New: Open an old version of the current file by selecting it from a commit list. v1.4.3 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

It makes TSE's Help show a bullet character if it did not, and for all code pages it makes Console TSE show a BIG bullet character. TSE's Help contains a lot of bullet-pointed text, but newer TSE GUI users will never have seen that, and other TSE versions and variants have issues with the bullet character too. The main reason for this extension was, that in newer GUI TSE versions, its Help shows a bullet character as a space character, making what should have been bullet-pointed text look like cluelessly indented paragraphs.

For older TSE versions down to TSE Pro v4.0 you can download it here. Functionality: When a Find or Replace hilites one of its matches, then all other matches currently on the screen are hilited too. It does so as a side effect to using existing Find and Replace keys without interfering with their functionality. It can hilite once, or it can keep hiliting the last search while you continue editing, and stop hiliting when a configured "stop key" is pressed. Strong points: It also hilites during a Replace's (Yes/No/...) prompts. You can configure different hiliting colours for the extra matches. It hilites a Replace with the Replace search options. Weak point: It only hilites for commands started with a configured key. v1.1 Added Linux TSE compatibility.

histlist\histlist.mac;                                                    - HistList.zip; v1.0.2 9 Dec 2022 TSE Pro v4.0 upwards This extension makes the use of TSE history lists a lot more efficient. When in a history list, just start typing a part what you search for to reduce the list to matches of what you typed. Example 1: This often allows me to only type a file's name without having to supply its folder. Example 2: By typing "-a" in the history list I can quickly select the previously entered string again that opens all TSE macros. v1.0.2 adds the left mouse button to select a history entry.

Delete an entire history list. Define cleanup-rules per history list. This will continuously and automatically keep your history lists clean. As an example this distribution is preconfigured to remove temporary files and macro executions from your _EDIT_HISTORY_ . Version 5.0.6: Optimized the Help file. Added a cleanup of a history list just before viewing it: this also makes a new or modified Cleanup Rule immediately effective. Version 5.0.5: Bug solved: When showing the overview of history lists, the number instead of the name of the _GOTOLINE_HISTORY_ was shown. Bug solved: If you had defined "^$" as a Cleanup Rule, then TSE hanged when you tried to close it. Version 5.0.4: Bug solved: a harmless warning at TSE's startup was removed. It happened for people with a small number of history lists. Version 5.0.3: Renamed "Exclude Rules" to "Cleanup Rules", which is more appropriate, because history entries are automatically removed some time AFTER entering a history list. Bug solved: defining Cleanup Rules for histories 10 and 13 would probably fail and possibly disturb other Cleanup Rules. Luckily it is very unlikely that anyone would want to define a Cleanup Rule for history 10 or 13. To solve this problem the format of the configuration file History.not was changed: a History.not file in the old format is automatically converted to the new format. Version 5.0.2 solves a bug: Closing TSE hanged if no Cleanup Rules were defined. Default there ARE Cleanup Rules defined, so there is hope that not too many people encountered this bug.

The main changes for version 3 are: In the HTML version of the manual links are now identical to those of TSE's Help. This means no more missing links and no more excessive linking wherever a topic's name, word or phrase is used. The HTML manual now has actual bold and italic text where the Help uses colors for these. The manual now includes the Help's InfoBoxes as "Info->..." topics. The manual now also includes those not-indexed topics that are linked to from indexed topics. The tool no longer supports the unused "Word" and "Generic" text formats. You can still open the full HTML file in Word. Macro programmers: Technical notes about what I discovered about the insides of the Help are described in the source coude in a "technical info" section, and here on the site are two tools that helped with this discovery and with verification of its correctness. v3.0.3 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

huffman\huffman.mac;                                                      - Huffman.zip; v1 5 Apr 2021 Windows TSE Pro v4.0 upwards, Linux TSE Beta v4.41.41 upwards This tool encodes (compresses) or decodes (decompresses) the current buffer to a new buffer it creates. Its main feature is, that it does so solely with TSE's capabilities, i.e. without any dependency on a non-TSE third-party tool. It is not compatible with with any other compression tool. It is intended as a helper tool for TSE-specific applications. v1 There was a v0.2 beta release of this tool. Here is what is new in the v1 version: Changed: After an encoding or decoding error the tool no longer produces a new buffer. Changed: Calling the "Huffman" macro (usage 1) no longer names the new buffer it creates, which pulls its behaviour in line with the other three usages. Added: If their input buffer is 10,000 or more lines, then encoding and decoding show a progress message. Fixed: Encoding plus decoding added an empty line to the end of a non-binary buffer. Fixed: No error was given for the fact that the tool cannot encode a buffer with less than two different characters. Fixed: No errors were given if the number of encoded and decoded/decodable characters did not match. And: Various small tweaks.

indentresize\indentresize.mac;                                            - IndentResize.zip; v2.1 13 Nov 2019 TSE PRo v4.0 upwards This tool changes a file's indentation primarily by changing its tab size. Note that the program name has become 1 letter shorter from version 1. This macro refuses to work for a file with tab characters. If a file has them, then first use any of the many other solutions to get rid of those pesky things. Some indentation theory I made up: Indentation can be tab-size-based or alignment-based. In natural text tab-size-based indentation is typically used for lists of points or to make a block of text stand out as a block. In programming tab-size-based indentation is typically used to visually group a sequence of statements as the subject of a condition or iteration by indenting lines one single extra tab-size unit. Alignment-based indentation however can have any size, including not conforming to any multiple of the current tab-size. Alignment-based indentation is generally used to align the first character of a line with a character on a previous line to visually indicate a semantic similarity between the content at those two positions. A rule of alignment-based indentation is, that between the alignment-indented line and the line of the content it aligns with there can be no lines with a lesser indentation. Based on this theory this tool (and we) can reasonably recognize these two types of indentation and differentiate between them. However, if a text uses tab characters instead of space characters, then we would at the same time have to recognize both alignment types and the tab size. That would be non-trivial. Luckily the days that computer memory was so expensive that the tab character's disadvantages were acceptable have passed. Modern plain text editors default to inserting the appropriate amount of space characters when we use the tab key. Therefore I chose for this tool not to cater to tab characters and their users. v2.0 adds, that (typically in program source code) aligned lines are correctly reindented too. v2.1 changes no functionality. It adjusts the source file extension from .si back to the standard .s. Also its array implementation was completely rewritten to, while more verbose, to be usable in normal macros.
indentview\indentview.mac;                                                - IndentView.zip; v1 25 Aug 2021 TSE Pro v4.0 upwards This tool can be used to navigate and gain insight into large recursive lists and program source code. It accomplishes this by compressing text into a list of lines with a certain maximum indentation, which you can control with the Right and Left keys. For example, it compresses a shopping / todo / notes list of increasingly indented topics and subtopics into a new list of only the (sub)topic lines, where you control which level of subtopics you want to see. As another example, programs typically use indentation to clarify their structure. Top-down this tool works somewhat like TSE's "Function List" menu, but with the added capability that it can then include lines with ever increasing indentation, which gives some insight into the program's structure. Bottom-up this tool shows lines with the current line's indentation or less, which gives insight into what the current line's place in the program structure is.

inserttaglines\inserttaglines.mac;                                        - InsertTaglines.zip; v1.0 21 Jan 2019 TSE PRo v3.0 upwards This tool creates a new file from the current file, where every line containing a supplied regular expression is put before itself and before every next line that does not contain that regular expression. Afterwards you can use existing TSE functionality to search all lines in combination with their tag lines, or to sort the now ubiquitous tag lines on their columns. When you are done you have the option to remove the inserted tag lines with a column block to get the original file format back. For example, given the file content:   id=1   name="Bob"   street="Main street"   city="Metropolis"   id=2   name="Alice"   street="Station street"   city="Gotham" It can create the new file content:   id=1 id=1   id=1 name="Bob"   id=1 street="Main street"   id=1 city="Metropolis"   id=2 id=2   id=2 name="Alice"   id=2 street="Station street"   id=2 city="Gotham"

It uses a Keys.ui interface definition file in TSE's "mac" folder. Its syntax is like a standard TSE .ui file with some minor restrictions. It does not compile with Macro Compile, but is compiled when you save the file. For example, I use it in the Windows GUI version of TSE to assign a triple tap of the <.> key to the "." (ellipsis) character, a triple tap of the <e> key to the "?" (euro) character, a triple tap of the <?> key to the "¨" character, and the tapping of <1></><2> to the "«" character. Likewise you could for example assign different actions to a double, triple and quadruple tap of the <Home> key. In Linux it is ideal for typing characters with diacritical marks in the same way Windows does for "international" keyboards. For example, you can enter an "" by quickly typing the <'> and <e> keys. More such examples are given in the example Keys.ui file that is included with the macro. v1.0.3 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

Like the Match macro, for the bracket under the cursor it jumps to its counterpart, but as requested by a user it ignores any in between commented brackets. So it "matches uncommented" brackets. [Is that even English?] I do NOT recommend substituting Match by MatchUnCom. MatchUncom has known flaws: It blindly assumes that comment colours are always delimiter colours, which for some configurations might be false. It is badly tested. The user's example test case worked on the first try, and I did not test any further.

The font size is temporarily adjusted both based on your current monitor's screen size and on the number of menu options. Note that it will not automatically resize existing TSE menus: that is a job for a macro programmer who could use this macro as an example. v1.0.1 solves the bug, that the whole screen was resized smaller when TSE's screen was not maximized. Now TSE's screen is maximized during the resizing and showing of the menus.

The usefulness of this macro lies primarily in that it contains a procedure which can be copied into your own macros. Often regular expressions that can match an empty string are not useful. Worse, they can also be dangerous when used for searching inside a loop, which can then become infinite because the empty string always matches without advancing the cursor. This macro [procedure] returns zero for such regular expressions, and thus helps you and your macro recognize and avoid useless and dangerous searches.

With this macro installed you only get a warning for the first such file, after which ALL warnings are disabled, but only for the duration of the current user command. For instance, if you open a 100 files using the "-a" option and a wildcard character, and you then search them all at once using the "a" search option; then this macro ensures that that you have to press OK at most once on a "Long lines split: ..." warning, even if all 100 files have them.

When you edit a file from outside of the editor, the single instance of TSE gets notified. It then opens the file, and brings itself to the foreground. Updated to solve focus issues under Win98 and Windows 2000. It can also now work with programs that expect the editor to terminate only when you are finished editing a file.

OnlyOne allows only one copy of TSE to run on a windows 9x/NT/2000 platform. When you edit a file from outside of the editor, the single instance of TSE gets notified. It then opens the file, and brings itself to the foreground. Updated to solve focus issues under Win98 and Windows 2000.

opencursor\opencursor.mac;                                                - OpenCursor.zip; v0.1 7 May 2020 Windows TSE Pro v4.4 upwards This TSE extension allows us to open URLs that occur in the text. This is a very early beta with known imperfections and lots of missing features. Planned features include: Opening URLs that do not start with "http", opening files, highlighting openable URLs and files in the text, some backwards compatibility, some Linux compatibility. In development Because TSE's Help has not been properly maintained since TSE 4.4 was released in 2005, I want to be able to add my own notes to TSE's Help, to enable others to do the same, and to provide a way to easily exchange them. (14 Dec 2022) Blog about implementing TSE's extended Help. (18 Nov 2022) eHelp currently (re)initializes tsehelp.ehelp when necessary, shows the Help's OEM characters when editing a .ehelp file, including drawing-characters like lines, shades and blocks, replaces the Help page for AbandonEditor and Statements for user "eCarlo", (still roughly!) syntax checks a .ehelp file when it is saved. eHelp v0.13: At start-up both helper macros are now checked for, and if needed recompiled. eHelp_SyntaxCheck v0.2 Added a fast superficial syntax check of the inner text of same-line tag pairs for "^" and ";" depending on each tag name. eHelp v0.12: Show OEM characters when editing a .ehelp file. This includes the drawing-characters that the TSE version and variant supports. eHelp v0.11: Removed the _DISPLAY_HELP_ mode when editing a .ehelp file. Added an eHelp.syn file to the eHelp file. eHelp v0.10: Automatic syntax check after .ehelp save. More simple syntax checks. The tough ones still need doing. eHelp v0.9: Partially unconfused editing a .ehelp file past the window-width by turning off the cursor. eHelp v0.8: Fixed a seemingly harmless error in the Help's Control buffer. An infinite redirect now "succeeds" in retrieving a "help screen" that reports the infinite redirection with the guilty .ehelp file as an error, rather than moving on to querying the next Help source. To communicate retrieved topic information back to TSE's Help, buffer strings are used that now more logically use the Help's topic buffer instead of the Help's control buffer. If the help topic's source is not TSE itself and it fits before the topic title, then the help topic's source is displayed in the top left help border. Marked text is now shown if you edit a .ehelp file. (13 Oct 2022) tsehelp.ehelp is the low-level conversion of TSE's tsehelp.hlp and compile.hlp into a readable file. Be warned: a web browser cannot show its OEM character encoding properly. Currently the best way to view it is in TSE with the eHelp extension loaded. (3 Sep 2022) Preliminary brainstorm about extending TSE's Help. I welcome suggestions and criticisms! UniView v2 Date: 10 Sep 2022 This is a placeholder for version 2 of the UniView extension for TSE. I realised two major improvements might be possible: It might be possible to get rid of UniView's flickering line updates by using TSE's HookDisplay() command. It might be possible to make UniView work for the current line too. These improvements would again bring TSE major steps closer to being a full Unicode editor. SmoothScroll Date: 25 Jun 2022 This is a placeholder for a SmoothScroll extension for TSE. In creating the Uniview extension I noticed how the parameters of the Windows TextOut API might be used to implement smooth scrolling in TSE. One day I would like to try if this works, for the fun of it. It does not have any priority because it lacks functional advantages. Demo TSE macros

This extension allows you to make any number of named palettes of 16 foreground and 16 background colors, which each can be any of 16,777,216 RGB colors. A selected palette is persistent across TSE sessions. So, if you just want a different shade of red, or you want to match your TSE border and menu colors with your Windows theme colors, or you want to make your own TSE nature or party theme, or you want to create an old green, amber or black-and-white monitor theme, then this is the extension for you. v1.1 If the ColorPicker tool is installed, then the Palette extension now uses it as its internal color picker. Palette's submenu now uses the <Ctrl I> and <Ctrl E> keys to differentiate between using its internal and external color picker. v1.1.2 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

A TSE picklist is used by the File Open menu, TSE's file manager, and more. This functionality was requested by two users. Installation note: There is a newer extension PickList, which shrinks a picklist to only those files that match the typed search string. The new PickList and the old PickListFind should not be installed together. v1.0.2 Fixed that PickListFind did nothing in someone else's TSE installation.

In TSE a picklist is a file list with a known TSE format. Picklists are used by the File Open menu, TSE's file manager, and more. This extension hacks TSE's picklists. While so far it seems to work really well, I have cause to first release it as a beta. PickList default does not work for regular lists, because in general it can damage some of them permanently. However, you can configure PickList for regular lists. Read the documentation for more details about for which regular lists it is safe to do so. Known safe regular lists: List Open, View Finds. Known unsafe regular lists: List Recent, Potpourri. Installation note There is an older extension PickListFind. PickList and PickListFind should not both be installed. In my superior opinion, PickList is vastly superior to PickListFind. ?? v0.4: Fixed: If (re)entering a picklist by typing a menu letter, the menu letter no longer becomes a picklist search letter. Fixed: When selecting a subfolder in a picklist, that was shrunk by a search string, the subfolder's picklist no longer inherits the search string. Fixed: The search string hiliting in a picklist no longer disappears if you perform an action on the picklist that does not leave it. For example: Sorting a shrunken picklist in the TSE File Manager. v0.5: Allows configuration of the shrink-as-you type behavior for SOME regular lists too. This potentially dangerous feature is default not configured. Read the documentation! v0.6: Fixed: Typing any letter in one of the EditFile macro's prompts (typically y/n), no longer adds that letter to PickList's search string.

Allows you to edit or view the docs for a Perl module by name (e.g. Apache::Session, Net::FTP). The name is picked up from the current line in the file you are editing, so all you have to do is move the cursor to a 'use' or 'package' statement in your Perl program and press a key to edit or view the module!. For editing, it will search for the module in a list of module directories on your system. To view the docs for a module it will launch your web browser and navigate to the documentation on http://www.perldoc.com/ by default, although this also can be configured. Also included is a simple Perl CGI script that you can install on your own web server to view documentation for the modules you have installed on that system.

ring092\ring092.mac;                                                      - Ringlets - Allow TSE to maintain more than one ring of files. BETA: v0.9.2 (Jun 19, 2002). Ringlets lets you have multiple rings of files in TSE. It is like having multiple virtual editors inside of a single editing session!. You can use these rings for whatever purpose you like. Here are some common uses: Load several large multi-file projects, and keep them all independent by putting each into a separate ring. Unlike using separate instances of TSE, files common to both projects will only be loaded into TSE once. A simple project loader macro (LoadProj) is included. During an editing session you can create a temporary ring containing just a couple of frequently-used files so you can switch back and forth between them easily. Newly edited files get filtered into their own ring based on file type (this is very powerful when used with the OnlyOne macro: for instance you could use TSE as your web browser's source viewer, and have all these files go into a separate ring). You can create an Instant Filter: a new ring which contains a subset of files in the current ring, based on file type. For instance, you could create an Instant Filter to list all files in the current ring which have the extension ".txt". Some other features: Buffer lists can switch between displaying filename only, or the full path. Additionally, you can setup plugin macros to display a friendly name for certain files (e.g. the <title> of an HTML file). Plugins for HTML files and Perl modules are included. Sort each ring's buffer list alphabetically. Tweak the order by moving individual files up and down in the list. Editing variables (tab type, margins, etc) and the current directory are saved separately in each ring. Files can be in more than one ring at once. The built-in virtual [all] ring contains every loaded file. The [unfiled] ring contains files that are not in any other user-defined ring. The Find or Replace 'all files' option is now limited to search only the files in the current ring. If you want to search every loaded file, you can use the [all] ring). Platform: TSE 3.x only Requirements: none. Author: Michael Graham.

Directories containing only empty directories are listed too. You can examine and edit the resulting TSE buffer, and rename it to a .cmd file to execute it to remove the listed directories.

This macro protects text to the right of a column block from being pulled into the block when a replace text is shorter than the find text in a Replace() operation. This is for the specific instances where large amounts of find text (typically spaces) are removed using Replace(). Normally, when this is done in a column block, the text outside the block to the right is pulled into the block as the reducing replacements take place, and the pulled in text becomes part of the find text and replacement is done there, too. This macro is particularly beneficial when doing columns of text or data, since a properly marked column block will completely protect all columns to the right of the block from movement or change.

This is not a working macro! It is only half built. I am just sharing what I have been working on. This macro's theory is, that you can search for a string which spans lines by putting a "slide" of lines under a "microscope", and moving the slide from the beginning to the end of the file in such a way, that the macro can use TSE's own Find command search each slide as if it was one line! Well, the slide part is largely implemented, the search part not at all. When implementing the search part, it will have impact on the slide part, which probably needs a little extending then.

syncase6\syncase6.mac;                                                    - When you are typing it formats known sets of keywords to their predefined combination of upper and lower case letters. Or you can "case" a whole file at once. From TSE Pro 2.8 upwards it uses TSE's own syntax hiliting keywords to determine their predefined casing. For TSE Pro 2.5 it is preconfigured for TSE's own macro language and Cobol. For higher TSE Pro versions it contains a "cased" SAL syntax hiliting file wich in SynCase v5 was updated for TSE Pro 4.4. SynCase v6 makes SynCase clean up its _edit_file_ history, which was disturbing the OpenType macro. Needs Global.zip, MacPar3.zip, ClipBor2.zip.

syncase\syncase.mac;                                                      - SynCase.zip; v7.1 6 Oct 2022 Windows and Linux TSE Pro v4 upwards Out of the box this TSE extension enhances the editing of TSE macro source code by setting keywords to their default predefined UPPER, lower, and CamelCase as you type. SynCase v7 was rewritten to make use of the latest TSE capabilities and is compatible with Linux TSE. Its configuration reuses the delimiters and keywords from TSE's syntax hiliting configuration to determine the casing of keywords. For TSE's macro language it can set keyword casing back to its default values if you ever lost them, which unfortunately a sneaky TSE feature can trick you into doing. It can be turned on and off per mapping set of TSE extensions. As this implies you can configure it for other languages as well. You can configure non-keywords to be UPPER or lower cased. For Linux TSE and for SynCase's full features you need at least TSE v4.41.19 upwards. For older Windows TSE versions from v4 upwards an old version of SynCase is included. v7.0.2 Fixed an incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable. v7.1 Added 38 missing SAL keywords to case. All of them occur in Semware's distributed TSE macros. As of this date (6 Oct 2022) they are missing in TSE's syntax hiliting too, and need to be added there too to hilite and case them. Details are in SynCase.s's "HISTORY" section at 7.1. The missing keywords are: Keywords 4: DetabColumnBlocks. Keywords 5: GERMAN, COPYTO_CURR, LINUX, LOCKFIX, MORE_KEYWORDS, _DONTLOAD_, _PICK_BUFFER_FN_COL_. Keywords 6: ax, bx, cx, dx, height, Cleanup, Default, Flags, Prologue, Startup, Black, Blink, Blue, Bright, Cyan, Green, Intense, Magenta, Red, White, Yellow. Keywords 7: FindInfoPtr, GetOutputDriver, SetOutputDriver, HookDebugger, Interp, intr, LockMacroId, UnLockMacroId. Keywords 9: KeyPad0.

This macro synchronizes (by ftp) directories from a pc to a server and/or back. I use it after changing my offline website to update my identical online website. I have a syncdir.bat file that simply contains:       @call \tse32\g32.exe -eSyncDir The macro needs macpar3 from SemWare's website to be installed first. Like the version number indicates, the macro was and is a bit of a hack for my personal use, and is provided as is, with no garanty whatsoever.

This is the TSE macro that handles the SynTaxHilite Mapping menu. Its major improvement is that the "Overlay Settings from Mapping Text File" menu option now default proposes the read same text file as the "Write Settings to Mapping Text File" menu option proposes to write to. Minor improvement: The .syn file shown in the menu is nor 2 characters longer, and if the filename is too long, then its end instead of its front is shown.

Summarized answer for TSE 4.42: It reports no errors or warnings. It notes 337 subtopics that are never addressed, with the technical reason why. The latter is technically interesting, because of the Help's multiple implicit rules for addressing a subtopic. For an extreme example; there are 3 subtopics for which there is a link to their address, but they are not addressed with their specific topic, and while their address does not overlap with a topic address, their address is the same as that of an earlier occurring subtopic. The never-addressed subtopics are technically an error, but in practice they cause nothing to malfunction and only hamper Semware's maintenance of the Help, so they only get a note instead. Here is a look at its report.

text2html\text2html.mac;                                                  - Text2html.zip; v1.2.3 31 Dec 2021 Windows TSE Pro GUI v4.0 upwards with an ANSI compatible font. It only partially works in other Windows TSE Pro v4 versions. This tool converts a text buffer to an unsaved HTML page including TSE's syntax highlighting. The result can be used as (a snippet in) a web page or an email. For an HTML example with style attributes, see how the following text is embedded in this HTML page. This is not a picture, but text, that can be marked and copied as text: // Example highlighted code snippet // generated with this tool. proc Main()   string  response [10] = ''   integer number        = 0   while Ask('Number?', response)     number = Val(response)     Warn('The square of'; number;          'is'; number * number)   endwhile end Main For an HTML example of class attributes referring to a stylesheet, see the code snippets in TSE PRO Undocumented Features . For use in an email your email client needs to support the necessary HTML formatting. Use in an email works by saving the generated HTML page, opening the saved file in a web browser, and copying the highlighted text from the web browser into an email. If an email receiver's email client does not support this highlighting, they still tend to see the text, just not highlighted. Email clients that have been reported to support this highlighting: Outlook iOS mail Pegasus (if a message wrap option is set) eM Client Thunderbird v1.2 Added a choice whether to generate "style attributes" or "class attributes with a stylesheet" for the HTML colors. v1.2.3 Fixed: Now also works if TSE's cursor line is configured to be colored differently from other text lines.

uncrash\uncrash.mac;                                                      - UnCrash.zip; v1.1.1 17 Sep 2022 Windows TSE Pro v4.0 upwards Windows TSE Beta v4.41.37a upwards This TSE extension now has two functions. 1. For each TSE session that was open during a (Windows) crash, it automatically offers to recover one of those sessions each next time TSE is started. 2. At any time you can access the recent back-ups it made through a shrink-as-you-type list, and thereby retrieve deleted and previous versions of recent files. I created this extension because historically all my Windows home PCs have tended to occasionally crash, especially during the summer months. Then in practice I found out that I also used it to retrieve (old versions of) files. v1.1 Added a user-friendly interface to at any time list and retrieve UnCrash's backup files. Fixed Uncrash v1.0.7 showing a system buffer if it was started manually. Undid the change in v1.0.7 to not report a crash if the Close button of the GUI version of an older TSE version than v4.41.46 was used. Semware improved the Close button in TSE v4.41.46, so UnCrash's fix is no longer necessary for newer versions of TSE and even hampered it, and it was too much work to make UnCrash support both the fixed and older versions of TSE when there is a free public newer TSE version available. v1.1.1 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's '-i' command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable.

unicode\unicode.mac;                                                      - Unicode.zip; v2.6 24 Sep 2022 Windows GUI TSE PRo v4 upwards with an ANSI compatible font, Linux TSE Beta v4.41.35 upwards This extension enables TSE to recognize and edit files for all major Unicode encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, including their variants; big endian (BE) and little endian (LE), and with or without a byte order mark (BOM). Installation: The Unicode extension requires the Status extension to be installed. If you are a user of the EolType extension, then you need to upgrade it to EolType v7. The older EolType versions do not understand the newline characters in the UTF-16 and UTF-32 files we can now edit. Key features: For Unicode characters that have an ANSI equivalent the ANSI character is shown. Typically this already covers the most frequently used Unicode characters that are not ASCII characters: ? '  " . Å Î ^ % S < O Z ' ' " "  - - ~ T s > o z Y ­ ½  Ï ¾ Ý õ ù ¸ ¦ ® ª ð © î ø ñ ý ü ï æ ô ú ÷ û § ¯ ¬ « ó ¨ · µ ¶ Ç     Ô  Ò Ó Þ Ö × Ø Ñ ¥ ã à â å    ë é ê  í è á     Æ          ¡   Ð ¤  ¢  ä  ö   £   ì ç  Other Unicode characters are shown as quoted hexadecimal Unicode codepoints, using the DELETE character (shown as a square-like character) as quotes. You do not have to remember these hexadecimal codes: The character's Unicode description is shown as a status. You can insert any character into your text by typing part of its Unicode name or description in a shrink-as-you-type list of characters. Viewing the current character in its real Unicode form is possible but default disabled because it works imperfectly. A file's character encoding (ASCII, ANSI, UTF-8/16/32[BE/LE][+BOM]) is shown as a status. You can explicitly change a file's character encoding by right-clicking or pressing [Shift] F10 on the status. Note that this allows you to convert any ASCII, ANSI or Unicode character encoding to any (other) Unicode character encoding. Conversions of character encodings are lossless! ASCII or ANSI files are semi-automatically upgraded to another character encoding when you type a non-ASCII or non-ANSI character. A lot of the above features can be tweaked in the configuration. Key lacking features: It does not display non-ANSI characters graphically. ANSI only covers the alphabets of languages like Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. To view a text's non-ANSI characters you can install the Uniview extension. It only supports Unicode for the content of files and ADSes. To access Unicode folder, file and ADS names use the Edit2 tool. Unicode info The Unicode Consortium has a fun 6 minute intro video. Tom Scott has an a bit more technical 9« minute intro video about UTF-8 specifically. The Unicode Consortium is Unicode's source of truth. Scroll all the way down their page for useful technical links. Wikipedia has helpful articles on Unicode in general, as well as on the specifics of UTF-8 , UTF-16 and UTF-32 . v2.5 New copy, cut and paste functions, that support ASCII, ANSI, and Unicode-encoded text to and from the Windows clipboard. v2.5.1 Fixed incompatibility with TSE's "-i" command line option and the TSELOADDIR environment variable. v2.6 Updated the data files to Unicode 15, which was released 13 Sep 2022. Fixed, that Unicode text copied to the Windows clipboard could not be pasted in a VirtualBox guest system.

uniview\uniview.mac;                                                      - Uniview.zip; v1.0.1 31 Oct 2022 Windows GUI TSE v4.0 upwards, with an ANSI-compatible font (like Courier New). TSE itself only supports 256 characters, 218 of which are displayable ANSI characters. Unicode supports 144,697 characters. The Uniview extension lets TSE display a text's Unicode characters. Installation note: The Uniview extension requires the Unicode extension, which requires the Status extension. Courier New Despite the fact that the Courier New font itself supports only about 2700 characters, you can configure TSE to make Windows augment that to almost all Unicode characters, and displayed in a high quality at that! See Uniview's documentation. Unifont I do not recommend the Unifont font, but it is a logical alternative to try for users who decide to try other fonts. I did, and I found no better alternatives to Courier New. I urge you to first read Uniview's documentation about Unifont's pros and cons, and for a link to a monospace version of the font. v1.0.1 fixes the bug, that at start-up Uniview left a marked block open in a system buffer. This caused users, who have the TSE option "Use Current Line If No Block" turned on, to get the error "Block not in current file" for trying to copy a not marked line.

This macro lets you view long lines window-wrapped while still editing the original unwrapped lines. Disclaimer: No it does not. This macro works imperfectly. History: v1.1       29 March 2009 A tilde indicator in the statusline shows if the file is in WinWrap mode. That only means that the file contains wrapped lines somewhere, not necessarily in the visible window. v1.0.2       26 March 2009 Solved: Auto-wrapping was not delayed when the macro was autoloaded and TSE was started with a file. v1.0.1       26 March 2009 Solved: The macro did not compile for TSE Pro 4.0: the isAutoloaded() function does not exist yet in that version of TSE.
winwrap_050\winwrap_050.mac;                                              - WinWrap_050.zip; 5 sep 2005 NOTE THAT THERE IS A NEWER VERSION OF THIS MACRO ON THIS SAME PAGE! This version is for historical purposes while the new version is being developed. V0.5 (a buggy beta) of the WinWrap macro, formerly known as the ScrnWrap and LongLine macro.   This is a windowwrapper, as opposed to a filewrapper.   It wraps lines that are longer than the current window is wide, but it only wraps them on-screen, not in the editing buffer or the disk-file.   It therefore does not interfere with most editor functions.   However, it therefore does interfere with syntax hiliting, block marking, find marking, the "[End of File]" indicator, and the WhtSpc macro. New in Version 0.5:   Made the macro deactivate itself when there is blockmarking in the current window, and reactivate itself as soon as there is not any more.   If the WhtSpc macro is loaded, then it is deactivated during wrapping, and reactivated as soon as there is no more wrapping.   Executing the macro now toggles it on and off. Alas, turning it on again is subject to a known bug. I will not not develop this macro any further, because I have concluded that the current approch is not fully compatible with TSE's implementation. TSE has a (for this macro's purpose) nasty habit. "Normal" screen updates can immediately be corrected and overwritten by hooks, but screen updates as the result of scrolling can only be corrected with the _idle_ hook, which happens so much later that it causes the screen to flicker. Besides that there is a "no screen updating" bug.   I have concluded that the current approach of creating a reformatted screen over the image of the original file will never work satisfactory. Another approach might be temporarily formatting the file itself, and (e.g. before saving) being able to reformat it back. A second alternative might be to show a formatted shadow-file to the user.   That said, this macro's functionality is so low on my list of priorities, that its development is hereby stopped.

A.k.a. an experiment in programmed fine-textured drawing with TSE. Based on a user's input I have extended its claimed compatibility to also include the Console version of TSE, but be aware that unless you yourself pre-set a large screen size and a small font size, the generated picture will have a too low resolution in the Console version of TSE. v1.0.2 It makes Xmas also compatible with TSE Pro v4.41.38 upwards.

While zooming, the screen size is kept as much the same as possible. To make a screen zoom size permanent, use the TSE menu "Options -> Save Current Settings". Zooming out is limited to where letters (have) become to small to read. Zooming in is limited to where a screensize of 80 x 25 characters would no longer fit, because that might stop TSE's menus from working. v1.3 Allows disabling its incompatibility warning for TSE's Console version.
