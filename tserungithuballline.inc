aftrocr\aftrocr.mac;                                                      - 4 macros to help solve OCR scanning errors. FuBookDu: Deletes duplicate scanned adjoining identical pages. Ocr_bl : Using a massive list of word pairs, it replaces consistenly badly scanned words with their correct counterparts without any interaction from the user. At the end, the macro generates a report, which can be consulted before the text file is saved. 2wrdlist: This is the macro to use, when the OCR software mixes up two words, that by themselves are perfectly correct. You add such word pairs to the 2wrdlist.wrd file, and let the macro search for occurrences of these words in the text file, giving the user the choice to easily swap each such word in the text file. Goodcase: OCR software can have a problem determining the case of some letters: this macro solves such mistaken cases, using the surrounding letters to determine the correct case.

history\history.mac;                                                      - Avoid history lists deleting each other. Get an overview of all history lists with their names. Delete an entire history list. Define cleanup-rules per history list. This will continuously and automatically keep your history lists clean. As an example this distribution is preconfigured to remove temporary files and macro executions from your _EDIT_HISTORY_ . Version 5.0.6: Optimized the Help file. Added a cleanup of a history list just before viewing it: this also makes a new or modified Cleanup Rule immediately effective. Version 5.0.5: Bug solved: When showing the overview of history lists, the number instead of the name of the _GOTOLINE_HISTORY_ was shown. Bug solved: If you had defined "^$" as a Cleanup Rule, then TSE hanged when you tried to close it. Version 5.0.4: Bug solved: a harmless warning at TSE's startup was removed. It happened for people with a small number of history lists. Version 5.0.3: Renamed "Exclude Rules" to "Cleanup Rules", which is more appropriate, because history entries are automatically removed some time AFTER entering a history list. Bug solved: defining Cleanup Rules for histories 10 and 13 would probably fail and possibly disturb other Cleanup Rules. Luckily it is very unlikely that anyone would want to define a Cleanup Rule for history 10 or 13. To solve this problem the format of the configuration file History.not was changed: a History.not file in the old format is automatically converted to the new format. Version 5.0.2 solves a bug: Closing TSE hanged if no Cleanup Rules were defined. Default there ARE Cleanup Rules defined, so there is hope that not too many people encountered this bug.

onlyone\onlyone.mac;                                                      - OnlyOne allows only one copy of TSE to run on a windows 9x/NT/2000 platform. When you edit a file from outside of the editor, the single instance of TSE gets notified. It then opens the file, and brings itself to the foreground. Updated to solve focus issues under Win98 and Windows 2000. It can also now work with programs that expect the editor to terminate only when you are finished editing a file. (When you quit the file, TSE stays open, but control returns to the calling application.) Updated to work properly with the Becky Mail Client (allowing you to use TSE as Becky's message editor). It also has the ability to autosave all files when it looses focus. See included Read.me file. Authors: Rick VanNorman, Michael Graham OnlyOne.zip replaces OnlyOne.zip dated May 22, 2002

This macro protects text to the right of a column block from being pulled into the block when a replace text is shorter than the find text in a Replace() operation. This is for the specific instances where large amounts of find text (typically spaces) are removed using Replace(). Normally, when this is done in a column block, the text outside the block to the right is pulled into the block as the reducing replacements take place, and the pulled in text becomes part of the find text and replacement is done there, too. This macro is particularly beneficial when doing columns of text or data, since a properly marked column block will completely protect all columns to the right of the block from movement or change.
