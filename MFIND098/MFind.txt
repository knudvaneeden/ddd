    MFind - Enhanced replacement for the Find built-in

    1. INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    The MFind macro package is designed to replace TSE's built in
    find and replace functions with new versions that are slightly
    enhanced.

    The main enhancements are:

         * Beeps when returning to the first file in a search through all files

         * Can automatically set find options based on context (e.g. setting
           the 'lg' options when a block is marked in the current file)

         * Optional perl-style regular expressions.  As an added bonus,
           you can use the perl-style regular expressions in your
           own macros.  See "4. PERL-STYLE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS", below.


    2. INSTALLATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE: On TSE 2.5 (DOS) You will need to install the Profile
    package.  See Profile.txt in that package for instructions.

    Place the MFind.s, mfconst.si, findprof.si and setcache.si files in
    your macro source directory.  If you want to enable perl-style
    regular expressions, also place the perlrex.s file in your
    macro source directory.  Compile MFind.s.

    Note that the findprof.si and setcache.si files may already have
    been installed from another macro package. If so, you should not
    need to install them again.  But it's worth taking a quick check
    to see that you have the latest version of these files.

    To use MFind from within TSE, you will have to edit your User
    interface file (e.g. TSE.UI) and change your menus and key bindings
    to point to MFind instead of the built in search features.

    For instance:

        menu SearchMenu()
        ...
            "&Find..."      ,   ExecMacro("mfind -f")
            "&Replace..."   ,   ExecMacro("mfind -r")
            "&Again"        ,   ExecMacro("mfind -g")
        ...
        end


        <Ctrl f>                ExecMacro("mfind -f")
        <Ctrl l>                ExecMacro("mfind -g")
        <CtrlShift l>           ExecMacro("mfind -1 b -g")
        <Ctrl r>                ExecMacro("mfind -r")

    For a complete list of all of MFind's command line options,
    see the section "COMMAND LINE OPTIONS" below.


    3. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    The following command line option are available to MFind:

    Find, Replace, Again:
    --------------------

    -f   = perform a Find, asking for Search Text and Options
    -r   = perform a Replace, asking for Search Text, Replace Text and Options
    -g   = repeat the last Find or Replace

    Change Find Options:
    -------------------
    -a   = set the find options (absolutely)
    -1   = turn on some find options
    -0   = turn off other find options
    -y   = same as -1
    -n   = same as -0

    Change Sound Options:
    --------------------
    -q   = Turn off Sound Effects
    -s   = Turn on Sound Effects


    Examples:
    --------

    mfind -f       = Simple Find
    mfind -r       = Simple Replace
    mfind -g       = Simple Repeat (Find or Replace)
    mfind -f -1 x  = Find; Regexp option ('x') is on by default
    mfind -f -1 a  = Find; "All files" option ('a') is on by default
    mfind -g -s    = Repeat last find, turn on sound effects
    mfind -1 b -g  = Repeat last find, backwards (by turning on 'b')


    4. PERL-STYLE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    [ Note that this feature is disabled by default.  For
    instructions on how to enable it, see below under CONFIGURATION ]

    When the Perl-style regular expression syntax translator
    is enabled, you can search using Perl-style regular
    expressions instead of TSE-Style regular expressions.

    This feature is largely syntactic sugar, for those of us who
    regularly use Perl (and other Unix software) and find it hard
    to remember the regex syntax differences from platform to
    platform.  Not all Perl regex features are supported (of course),
    but many of the basics are.

    Here are some of the things you can type, and their TSE equivalents:

    Perl-Style  Description                              TSE Equivalent
    ==========  ===========                              ==============
    \s          Whitespace character                     [ \t]
    \S          Non-Whitespace character                 [~ \t]

    \d          Digit                                    [0-9]
    \D          Non-Digit                                [~0-9]

    \w          Word Character                           [A-Za-z_0-9]
    \W          Non-Word Character                       [~A-Za-z_0-9]

    \\          Literal Backslash                        \\

    [ ]         Character set                            [ ]
    [^ ]        Negated character set                    [~ ]

    ( )         Tagged Subpattern group                  { }

    *           0 or more of preceding, max. closure     @
    *?          0 or more of preceding, min. closure     *

    +           1 or more of preceding, max. closure     #
    +?          1 or more of preceding, min. closure     +

    @           Literal @ sign                           \@
    #           Literal # sign                           \#


    When Perl-style regular expressions are enabled, they are used
    any time you use the 'x' search option.  If you want to use
    TSE-Style regular expressions, use both the 'x' and the 'z'
    options together (the 'z' option disables all MFind plugins).

    Note that you can use Perl-Style regular expressions in your
    own macros, too!  The PRex_to_TRex() function in the perlrex.si
    file will do this:

        #include ['perlrex.si']

        if lFind(PRex_to_TRex('\d\d\d'), 'x')
            Warn('found three digits!')
        endif
        if lFind(PRex_to_TRex('\w+?'), 'x')
            Warn('found some word characters!')
        endif


    5. CONFIGURATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Most of the functionality of MFind can be enabled or disabled
    by making changes to TSE.INI.  (MFind searches for TSE.INI
    according to the rules in the FindProf package.)

    All MFind configuration options go under the [mfind]
    section of TSE.INI.

    Sound Effects
    -------------
    When Sound Effects are enabled, MFind will beep when text is not
    found, and also when returning to the starting file during
    a multi-file search.

    To enable sound effects, use:

        [mfind]
        Use_Sound=1

    To disable sound effects, use:

        [mfind]
        Use_Sound=0

    Sound Effects are on by default.

    Automatic Find Options for Blocks
    ---------------------------------
    When this option is set, MFind will automatically set and clear
    certain search options to make block handling easier.  These
    settings are added Of course
    you can override these

    If a block is marked in the current file, MFind will add the 'lg'
    options (meaning "search within the block, starting at it's
    beginning").  But, if the 'l' option is already set, the 'g'
    option will not be added.

    If no block is marked in the current file, MFind will remove
    from the search options 'l', 'lg', or 'lgn', depending on
    how many are present in the options string. (Note, however,
    that it will not remove 'g' or 'gn' if the 'l' option
    is not already present.)

    To enable Automatic Find Options for Blocks, use:

        [mfind]
        Auto_Block_Options=1

    To disable Automatic Find Options for Blocks, use:

        [mfind]
        Auto_Block_Options=0


    Perl-style regular expresssions and Translator Plugins
    ------------------------------------------------------
    The Perl-style regular expression syntax translator
    is enabled via a MFind Translator Plugin macro.

    To enable it:

        [mfind]
        Find_Text_Translator_Plugins=perlrex

    Now you can search using Perl-style regular expressions,
    simply by specifying the 'x' search option.  To use TSE-style
    regular expression, use both the 'x' and 'z' options.

    More information on PerlRex can be found in PerlRex.txt,
    included in this package.

    Normally, when MFind can't find a match for your regular
    expression, you will get a "not found" message, like
    "\d+ giant gerbils not found".

    In other words, the failed expression is displayed
    as you entered it, NOT as how it was translated by the
    perl-style regular expression plugin.

    If you would prefer to see the expression as it was
    rendered by perlrex, add the following configuration line:

        [mfind]
        Show_Translated_Text_On_Error=1


    Integration with other macros (advanced)
    ----------------------------------------
    To enable integration with macros that override the built in
    NextFile() and PrevFile() behaviour, MFind can run a macro for those
    commands instead of calling NextFile() or PrevFile() directly.

    To enable this functionality, specify the name of the
    macro and any arguments.  For instance:

        [mfind]
        Next_File_Macro=ringlets -n
        Prev_File_Macro=ringlets -p


    The use of Next and Previous macros to replace NextFile() and
    PrevFile() is disabled by default.


    6. FIND TEXT TRANSLATOR PLUGIN INTERFACE (ADVANCED)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Just after MFind asks for the Find and/or Replace text, but before
    it actually starts searching, MFind checks to see if any plugins
    are enabled.  If any are, MFind hands off the text and options
    to these plugins, one at a time.

    To register plugins, list them (separated by commas) as the value of
    the "Find_Text_Translator_Plugins option in the [mfind] section of
    the TSE.INI file.  For instance to enable a macro called "foo" and a
    macro called "bar" as text translator plugins, you would use

        [mfind]
        Find_Text_Translator_Plugins=foo, bar

    MFind executes the macros in the order listed, running each macro's
    main() procedure.

    It communicates to the macros via the following session-global
    variables:

        MFind::Find_Text    (String)  - Text that the user is searching for.
        MFind::Find_Options (String)  - Find Options that the user specified.

        MFind::Replace      (Integer) - Is this a replace (i.e. not a find)?
        MFind::Replace_Text (String)  - Replace text for the current search

    Within a plugin macro, you can read and change these values using
    the GetGlobalStr(), SetGlobalStr(), GetGlobalInt(), and SetGlobalInt()
    functions.

    Some helper routines for decoding the search options are also available
    in the mfconst.si file.  You can include it with the line:

        #include ['mfconst.si']

    This file provides functions for converting Find_Options to and from
    a bitmask, making it easy to test for specific options and to toggle
    options on and off.

    For instance:

        // Load the find options into a bitmask
        integer find_options = opts2bits(GetGlobalStr('MFind::Find_Options'))

        // Check to see if we are searching through all files.
        // if so, turn on the global flag ('g'), and turn
        // off the block local flag ('l')

        if find_options & MF_OPTS_A
            // Turn on the global flag
            find_options = find_options | MF_OPTS_G

            // Turn off the block local flag
            find_options = find_options & ~MF_OPTS_L
        endif

        // Conver the bit mask back to a string,
        // then set the global Find_Options variable
        SetGlobalStr('MFind::Find_Options', bits2opts(find_options))
