The following steps will allow you to set up TSE Jr. as an external editor for
TAPCIS 6.0.  I am assuming the use of a registered version of TSE Jr. when I
refer to support files.  (Items such as the spelling checker that is part of
the TSE Jr. 3.0 registered package.)  These instructions will work even with
the shareware version, __EXCEPT__ you will not have access to the support
files that I refer to.

0.   BE SURE THAT TSE Jr. AND ITS SUPPORT FILES (IF YOU USE THEM) ARE IN YOUR
     DOS PATH.  Otherwise, in Step 3 below, include the full path name to
     reach TSE Jr..

1.   Activate the SETUP > EDITORS > CONFIGURE menu options in TAPCIS 6.

2.   Select which external editor setting (1 or 2) that you want to
     configure as TSE Jr. and <TAB> to the first data entry field.

3.   Enter the following information for each field.

     Edit:     q

     Reply:    q root~.tmp editor~.tmp

     Write:    q editor~.tmp

4.   Select the save option and return to the main screen.

5.   (THIS IS THE SECRET TO MAKING IT WORK) Exit T6 and then restart it.  If
     you don't do this, the changes you made in the configuration are not
     saved to the proper location and you can't use the editor.

6.   Return to the SETUP > EDITORS sub-menu.  Select the number for the
     external editor as you configured it in Step 2 above.

7.   Get some messages to read.  When you see one that you want to reply to,
     simply press "R".  TSE Jr. will load both temp files into the editor, and
     you will be presented with a single screen showing the message you are
     replying to.

8.   (THIS STEP MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU HAVE TSE Jr. CONFIG'ED)
     Use the appropriate command from the keyboard or the menu (ESC, WINDOW,
     SPLIT) to create an additional horizontal window.  Typically you will
     be presented with a prompt box asking you which file to edit.  SELECT
     editor~.tmp -- that is, the one NOT shown in the title line of the
     upper window.  You will write your message in this window.

You can move back and forth between the files, if you feel the need to quote
from the first message.  When you are done responding, simply exit the program
with a file save.  You will be returned to the message reading area in T6.

BTW, if you are using the registered version of TSE Jr. 3.0 or later, you can
spell check the reply message before you save it.

Writing a new message is even simpler.  There is only one, blank screen to
worry about.  Simply start writing, spell check if desired, and save/exit.
