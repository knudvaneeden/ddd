The following steps will allow you to set up The SemWare Editor (TSE) as an
external editor for TAPCIS 6.0.  I am assuming the use of a registered
version of TSE when I refer to support files.  (Items such as the spelling
checker that is part of the TSE Pro registered package.)  These instructions
will work even with the shareware version, __EXCEPT__ you will not have
access to the support files that I refer to.

0.   BE SURE THAT TSE AND ITS SUPPORT FILES (IF YOU USE THEM) ARE IN YOUR
     DOS PATH.  Otherwise, in Step 3 below, include the full path name to
     reach TSE.

1.   Activate the SETUP > EDITORS > CONFIGURE menu options in TAPCIS 6.

2.   Select which external editor setting (1 or 2) that you want to
     configure as TSE and <TAB> to the first data entry field.

3.   Enter the following information for each field.

     Edit:     e

     Reply:    e root~.tmp editor~.tmp

     Write:    e editor~.tmp

     NOTE:     If you want to have TSE automatically split into two
               horizontal windows with the original message in the upper
               window and a blank message in the lower window for your
               reply, make the REPLY line look like this:

                    e root~.tmp editor~.tmp -estart

               Then, before you attempt to use TSE the first time, look at
               the instructions contained in the header section of the
               START.S macro file and follow them.  They will tell you how
               to set up the macro and compile it so that it is ready for
               use.

4.   Select the save option and return to the main screen of T6.

5.   (THIS IS THE SECRET TO MAKING IT WORK) Exit T6 and then restart it.  If
     you don't do this, the changes you made in the configuration are not
     saved to the proper location and you can't use the editor.

6.   Return to the SETUP > EDITORS sub-menu.  Select the number for the
     external editor as you configured it in Step 2 above.

7.   Get some messages to read.  When you see one that you want to reply to,
     simply press "R".  TSE will load both temp files into the editor, and
     you will be presented with a single screen showing the message you are
     replying to.  (If you use the "-estart", you will be in the lower
     window of a split screen with the message you are replying to in the
     upper window.)

8.   (THIS STEP MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU HAVE TSE CONFIG'ED)
     Use the appropriate command from the keyboard (<CTRL O, H> by default)
     or the menu (ESC, WINDOW, HORIZONTAL) to create an additional
     horizontal window.  You will write your message in this window.

You can move back and forth between the files, if you feel the need to quote
from the first message.  When you are done responding, simply exit the
program with a file save.  You will be returned to the message reading area
in T6.

BTW, if you are using the registered version of TSE, you can spell check the
reply message before you save it.

Writing a new message is even simpler.  There is only one, blank screen to
worry about.  Simply start writing, spell check if desired, and save/exit.

NOTE:     If you are doing work with a Windows-based word processor and like
          the ability to mark text with the SHIFT-arrows, consider adding
          the SHIFT macro to your AUTOLOAD List (on the Macro Menu).  This
          makes marking text very easy.  All of the keystrokes are indicated
          on the menu for moving back and forth (Window Menu) and copying,
          deleting, unmarking text (Block Menu).  Enjoy.
