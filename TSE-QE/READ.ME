The files contained in this ZIP contain instructions for setting up TSE Jr.
and The SemWare Editor (TSE) as external editors for TAPCIS 6.0.  The
following files are included in this ZIP.

     READ.ME             This file

     TSE Jr..INF           Setting Up TSE Jr. as an external editor

     TSE.INF             Setting Up TSE as an external editor

     START.S             A TSE macro source file for use with TSE and T6
                         (instructions contained in header)

If you are interested in using TSE Jr. as your editor, TSE Jr..INF is the only
file you will need.  If you would like a similar macro for splitting the
editor screen automatically, you will need to contact SemWare Support in
Section 6 of PCVENE Forum using [75300,2710] as the UID.  They will be more
than happy to help registered users.

If you are interested in using TSE, look at TSE.INF and START.S.  The
instructions contained in TSE.INF are similar to those in TSE Jr..INF, since
the basic setup of the two files is similar.  TSE.INF, however, provides
additional instructions for including a start-up macro (START.S) on the
reply line to allow automatic window splitting.

Review the appropriate information and use it as you see fit.  If you see a
way to improve on either the instructions or the macro, feel free to make
the desired changes and post the results.  I claim no rights to either the
macro or the information text files.  I am simply providing this information
to make the setup easier for others.
