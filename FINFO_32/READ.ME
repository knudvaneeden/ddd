FileInfo is a set of three macros which will enable you to easily view
DOS information for the current file, as well as modify it's DOS
attributes.

The majority of this code was developed by Steve Watkins & Kevin A.
Carr, of SemWare.  I would like to fully acknowledge not only their
work, but their gracious willingness in allowing me to make the
necessary modifications which enable me to put FileInfo together.

FileInfo is intended to be a useful addition to your SAL macro
collection, as well as an example (though a simple one) of the power
that is available using binary procedures.  If you have any questions,
or suggestions, please contact me, RAY ASBURY, via the SemWare BBS,
any of the echoed SemWare mail conferences, or on Internet as
rasbury@msmailpc01.saic.com.

The following files are included in FINFO_??.ZIP:

FILEINFO.MAC    When executed via ExecMacro("FILEINFO") a pop up window
                similar to the following will appear:

                    ฺฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ File Information ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฟ
                    ณ                                      ณ
                    ณ     Name      :  READ.ME             ณ
                    ณ     Size      :  943                 ณ
                    ณ     Date      :  05-07-93            ณ
                    ณ     Time      :  12:41:54            ณ
                    ณ     Attributes:  Archive             ณ
                    ณ                                      ณ
                    ณ  Press <Enter> To Change Attributes  ณ
                    ิออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

                If you then press <Enter>, the following window will
                appear, which lets you change the file's attributes:

                    ฺ Change File Attributes ฟ
                    ณ Read Only        [ No] ณ
                    ณ Hidden           [ No] ณ
                    ณ System           [ No] ณ
                    ณ Archive          [Yes] ณ
                    ภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤู

IS_READ.MAC     When executed via ExecMacro("IS_READ"), the global
                integer variable, "gCurrFileIsReadOnly",  will be set to
                TRUE if the current file is read-only, or FALSE
                otherwise.  This macro can be called with the following
                code anywhere you want to know if the file is read-only
                (such as in the ON_FIRST_EDIT or ON_CHANGING_FILES hooks
                macros):

                    ExecMacro("IS_READ")
                    IF (GetGlobalInt("gCurrFileIsReadOnly"))
                        Message("The current file is read-only")
                    ELSE
                        Message("The current file is not read-only")
                    ENDIF

TOG_READ.MAC    When executed via ExecMacro("TOG_READ"), the DOS
                read-only attribute for the current file will be
                toggled.  The following code shows how to incorporate
                TOG_READ with IS_READ to allow saving of read-only
                files:

                    ExecMacro("IS_READ")
                    IF (GetGlobalInt("gCurrFileIsReadOnly"))
                        CASE YesNo("File is read only.  Save anyway?")
                            WHEN 1
                                ExecMacro("TOG_READ")
                                SaveFile()
                                ExecMacro("TOG_READ")
                        ENDCASE
                    ENDIF

NOTE:  FILEINFO, IS_READ, & TOG_READ are all self-purging macros that do
       not contain any key bindings.  They do not modify any of your
       existing settings. Except for changing the current files
       attributes, if requested, their use, as shipped, should be
       transparent to the rest of your TSE implementation.

                procedures.
