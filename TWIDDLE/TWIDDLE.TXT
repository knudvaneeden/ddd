TWIDDLE is a very simple macro for The Semware Editor.  It exchanges the two
characters immediately to the left of the cursor.  Used mainly while typing.
For this reason, it *assumes* there are two alpha characters to be exchanged,
and has no protection against situations where this is not true (but then, its
action can be reversed by executing it again).

TWIDDLE is *copyleft* and *freeware*, and can not be sold.

 The man replied, `Things as they are   |     lbianchi@sol.yorku.ca
 Are changed upon the blue guitar.'     |    luigi.bianchi@rose.com
