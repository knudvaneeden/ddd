TSEFile is a file manager for TSE, implemented exclusively using TSE's
own macro programming language SAL. It allows you to execute all basic
file management tasks without leaving TSE, e.g. copying, renaming and
deleting files. You can view files in text and hex mode and navigate the
directory tree, which includes making and removing subdirectories.
Moreover, version 3.1 of TSEFile implements some advanced techniques,
which include:
    þ deleting, copying and moving directory trees,
    þ comparing files both binary and as lines of text,
    þ searching files by name and by text (grep),
    þ managing 4dos compatible file descriptions,
    þ running programs and associated files,
    þ viewing and extracting archived files.
