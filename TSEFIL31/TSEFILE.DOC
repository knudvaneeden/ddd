1. What Is TSEFile?
-------------------

TSEFile is a file manager for TSE, implemented exclusively using TSE's
own macro programming language SAL. It allows you to execute all basic
file management tasks without leaving TSE, e.g. copying, renaming and
deleting files. You can view files in text and hex mode and navigate the
directory tree, which includes making and removing subdirectories.
Moreover, version 3.1 of TSEFile implements some advanced techniques,
which include:
    þ deleting, copying and moving directory trees,
    þ comparing files both binary and as lines of text,
    þ searching files by name and by text (grep),
    þ managing 4dos compatible file descriptions,
    þ running programs and associated files,
    þ viewing and extracting archived files.


2. What's New?
--------------

2.1 Version 3.1
---------------

I did not plan to update TSEFile just after a few weeks, but to my great
dismay I found two rather unpleasant bugs. So here is Version 3.1 of the
program with bugs fixed (hopefully) and file comparison included.

  þ File comparison (binary)
        This feature works similar to copying files, except, of course,
        that the files are compared. It is fully recursive, which means
        subdirectory trees can be compared.

  þ Text comparison (TSEComp)
        Actually, this is a stand alone macro with an interface to
        TSEFile built in. See TSEComp.DOC for more information.

  þ Fixed bugs
        ù After copying or renaming descriptions across paths (function
          DupDesc in TSEFile.S), the wrong temporary buffer was cleared.
          This might have produced description files containing some
          garbage, but 'real' descriptions should not have been damaged.
        ù The Yes/No logic of the 'cancel operation box' within the file
          iterator (ForAllFiles) was reversed. Thus pressing <Enter>
          actually resumed the operation.


2.2 Version 3.0
---------------

Here is a list of all the things which have been changed, added or
de-bugged since version 2.01 of the program.

  þ Macro size
        Due to the size of the source code, TSEFile had to be split into
        three distinct macro files. The loading of the additional macros
        is handled automatically.

  þ National keyboards
        No more adaption of key bindings required. TSEFile has been
        rewritten such, that it will now work with any keyboard layout.

  þ Date and time format
        Date and time are now formatted using the internal TSE variables
        DateFormat, DateSeparator and TimeSpeparator.

  þ Speed search
        Now wraps around to the top of the file list, when the bottom is
        reached. Upper case letters search backwards.

  þ File browsing
        The way file browsing is implemented has been changed, to
        accommodate the new features of TSEFile.

  þ Confirmation logic
        The logic to confirm destructive actions, e.g. deleting and
        overwriting files, has been streamlined somewhat and adapted to
        the new features of TSEFile.

  þ More options
        More setup options have been added, so that some of the new
        features of TSEFile can be customized.

  þ Additional help
        All the various pick and browsing lists now have their own
        special help screen.

  þ Printing
        The file lists can now be printed or dumped to a file.

  þ File descriptions
        TSEFile now reads and writes 4dos compatible description files.
        File descriptions can be changed, copied and moved. If you copy
        or move a file, its description is copied along with it.

  þ Associations
        You can now associate a file extension with an application.
        Browsing a file with such an extension will launch the
        corresponding application with the file as an argument.

  þ File archivers
        You can view the contents of an archive (arj,lzh,zip), browse
        files within it and extract some or all of the files from the
        archive.

  þ File and text searching
        You can search files on an entire drive or only on part of it.
        The found files can additionally be searched for text (grep).

  þ Subtree management
        All the basic file management actions (copying, moving and
        deleting) can now be used with directories. These operations
        automatically include all the subdirectories and files below the
        chosen directory.

  þ Tree list
        TSEFile now manages a list of the directories of one or more
        drives. This list can be viewed and used to quickly change
        directories and drives.

  þ File marking
        Directories can now be marked, because they will be affected by
        file management actions.

  þ Extended wildcards
        All the prompts, which ask you to select files, now accept
        extended wildcards, which allow character ranges and *'s at the
        beginning or right in the middle of names and extensions.

  þ Fixed bugs
        ù Drives n and y could not be accessed with the change drive
          command. This has been fixed.
        ù Tab expansion was not switched off at program startup. This
          sometimes garbled file list entries. This has been fixed.
        ù The entry/exit code had some odd quirks, which have been
          fixed.


3. Installation
---------------

This package contains four kinds of files: the documentation, the source
code, the executables and the configuration files. To successfully
install the program neither the documentation nor the source code is
needed. This means you can store the following files in a safe place and
ignore them for the time being.

    tsefile.doc     no! you really shouldn't ignore this one!
    tsefile.s       main program file
    tsefile1.s      run time library (subtree management)
    tsefile2.s      run time library (menus and help screens)
    tsefileb.s      program loader used by tsefile.bat
    tsefile.src     include file (common constants)
    tsefile.asm     binary (dos functions, which SAL does not provide)
    tsefile.bin     compiled version of tsefile.asm

    tsecomp.doc     explanation of text file comparison
    tsecomp.s       program file for text comparison
    tsecompb.s      program loader used by tsecomp.bat
    fnprompt.src    include file (emulates the EditFile prompt)

The batch file tsefile.bat allows you to run TSEFile as a stand alone
application. Put it in a directory which is included in your path, e.g.
the same directory where TSE (e.exe) is stored. There is also a batch
file for TSEComp. Put it in the same directory as tsefile.bat

    tsefile.bat     command line version of TSEFile
    tsecomp.bat     command line version of TSEComp

The rest of the files should be placed in a directory where TSE can find
them, e.g. a directory which is included in your TSEPath. (If this
sounds all gibberish to you, just put the files into the mac directory,
which is directly below the place where TSE is located.)

    tsefile.mac     main program file
    tsefile1.mac    run time library (subtree management)
    tsefile2.mac    run time library (menus and help screens)
    tsefileb.mac    program loader used by tsefile.bat
    tsefile.cfg     configuration file (the options are stored here)
    tsefile.app     association file (associations are stored here)
    tsefile.tre     subdirectory trees (tree info is stored here)

    tsecomp.mac     program file for text comparison
    tsecompb.mac    program loader used by tsecomp.bat

The file tsefile.tre is not included in this package, but it will be
created the first time you configure the drives which TSEFile should
manage (Options|Drive). Be sure, to overwrite a version 2 configuration
file with the new one, because they are not compatible.

Now you are ready for test driving. To run TSEFile enter "tsefile" at
the "execute macro" prompt. You cannot run any of the other mac-files
(just try it), they will simply refuse to cooperate, because they are
not meant to be executed by the user. To quit TSEFile hit <Escape> and
<Enter> at the ensuing prompt.


4. Command Reference

The following list contains a short description of all the commands
available in TSEFile. The key bindings and the keys used to access the
menu system are also included. This list is a verbatim copy of part of
the main help screen of the program, which means that it is only a key

5. Using TSEFile
----------------


5.1 Basics
----------

To begin with, load TSEFile and have a short look on it. Don't worry
about lost files, because TSEFile will warn you before it overwrites or
deletes something. For now, just abort these operations by pressing the
<Escape> key. If you want to experiment a bit, there is plenty of on-
line help available. Pressing <F1> will pop up a help window describing
some general concepts and all the short cut keys there are. Furthermore
each pick list and each browsing list has its own special help screen.
Finally, if you access the menu system (<F10>), a short description of
what each command does is shown at the help line.


5.2 Navigating the Directory Tree
---------------------------------

TSEFile displays two directory listings, which both show the current
directory after the program has started. The highlight can be moved
using the cursor keys and individual files can be (un-)marked with the
<SpaceBar> or by <Left Clicking> them with the mouse. To switch the
active list press the <Tab> key. To quickly locate a file, press one of
the alphabetic keys and TSEFile will position you at the next entry in
the list, that begins with the corresponding character. (To search
backward use uppercase letters.) The contents of the lists can be
filtered using wildcards and can be sorted in a variety of ways.

To view another directory, position the highlight on a directory name
and press <Enter> or <Right Click> it with the mouse. Larger jumps are
available using the <F6> key. At the ensuing prompt you may enter
relative or absolute paths. If you include a drive letter and a colon
the current disk will also be changed (e.g., c:\tse will take you to the
tse directory on drive c, no matter where you are).

Moreover, TSEFile manages a list of directories on your drives, which
may also be used to change the current directory in a variety of ways.
To configure which drives TSEFile should manage use Options|Drives. You
can view a list of all directories on your drives (<Shift F9>) or only
the current directory and its subdirectories (<F9>). Furthermore, if you
enter a partial directory name at the <F6> prompt, TSEFile will display
a list of directories, which it thinks come closest to what you wanted.
To change the current directory, highlight one of the list entries and
press <Enter>.

If you want to save one of the file lists either as soft or as hard
copy, use Directory|Print. Finally, if you suspect, that TSEFile somehow
became confused about what the contents of a directory really is, press
<F5> and it will rebuild both directory listings from scratch.


5.3 Directory Management
------------------------

To add a new directory press <Ins> and enter the directory name. This is
undone using the <Del> key. Be careful, as this version of TSEFile is
capable of deleting subdirectory trees. TSEFile will always show a
warning message, when you try to remove a subdirectory tree. Using
Directory|Remove is a safer way to delete directories, because this
command will only remove empty subdirectories.

TSEFile can also copy and move directories. Highlight or mark the source
directory(ies) and press <Ctrl M> or <Ctrl C> and TSEFile will move or
copy these directory(ies) including all of their subdirectories and
files to the inactive directory. Again, moving will pop up a warning
box. By the way, you cannot disable these "directory destruction"
warnings, because recursive deletion IS dangerous.

Finally, you can rename a directory using the <F7> key.


5.4 File Management
-------------------

Most of the file management commands use either the highlighted file or
the marked file(s). In the latter case TSEFile ignores the highlighted
file, if it is not marked.

You can copy and move files from the active to the inactive directory
using <Ctrl C> or <Ctrl M>. Alternatively you can drag the current or
the marked files with the mouse. Just click in the active window and
move the mouse curser over to the inactive window without releasing the
mouse button. This will move the files. If you additionally hold down
the <Ctrl> key, the files will be copied instead. The indicator box
shows you, what will happen and how many files will be affected.

You can rename or duplicate files using <F7> or <F8>. These commands
also accept file paths, allowing you to rename files across directories
(but not across disks). Finally, hit <Del>, if you want to delete some
files. (Once again, look out for marked directories.)


5.5 Comparing Files
-------------------

Files can be compared both in binary mode and as text files. Binary
comparison (<Ctrl-O>) works similar to the copy command, which means
that everything that is marked in the active file list will be compared
to the corresponding item in the inactive list. This includes comparing
subdirectories and all the files they contain.

After the comparison has finished, TSEFile tells you either that all the
files were identical or it pops up a list showing all the differences
found. This list contains the full path of the file and an indication of
what is wrong.

        directory   the directory was not found in the inactive list
        missing     the file was not found in the inactive list
        length      the file sizes differ
        ######      the position of the first mismatching byte

Comparing text files works on a line to line basis, in contrast to
binary comparison, which works on a one to one basis. Position the
highlight on the file you want to compare and press <F4>. TSEFile (in
fact TSEComp) will then ask for the name of the second file. Press
<Enter> and you will be put into an environment, which allows you to
compare and update two text files. This environment is a stand alone
macro named TSEComp. It may also be called from the command line or
can be executed directly from within TSE. See the file TSEComp.DOC for
further instructions.


5.6 Browsing and Launching
--------------------------

If you want to inspect the contents of one of your files, <Right Click>
it or press <Enter> and TSEFile will display the file in text mode.
<Shift Enter> will do the same, except that TSEFile will put you in hex
mode. If you want to edit a file, press <F3> to load it or <Shift F3> to
to load it and simultaneously quit the file manager.

Actually, something completely different could happen, depending on the
extension of the current file. If the current file is a program, it will
simply be executed in a dos shell. If it is a SAL macro, TSEFile will be
terminated and the macro will be executed.

Furthermore, there is a list of so-called associations, which determines
which application should be used to view files with certain extensions.
If you ever used the Windows file manager, you know what these
associations are. Simply put, if you view an associated file, the
corresponding application is launched with the filename as a command
line argument. This will run the program and simultaneously load the
file. E.g., if you associated the file extension "pas" with a program
named "bp.exe", then <Right Clicking> the file example.pas would run
"bp.exe" and would automatically load the "example.pas" file into bp.
Associations are stored in a file named TSEFile.APP and can be edited
using Options|Associations.

Associations can be used to set up archive viewers. The associations
setup menu has a submenu Archive. If you leave the entries of this
submenu blank, you made a normal association, which just launches an
application with the current filename as an argument. But, if you fill
in the entries of the Archive menu, you make an archive viewer. The
extract command is exactly that, the command used to extract a file from
the archive. "Skip Until" and "Skip From" are regular expressions, which
define the portions at the top and bottom of the archive listing which
should be ignored. "Name Filter" is a regular expression which defines
where the filename can be found in a line of the archiver listing.

TSEFile comes with an association file, which contains archiver setups
for three of the most popular archiver programs (arj, lzh and zip). The
rest of the associations serve mainly as examples on how to do it.
Finally, you can launch any file within any application by pressing
<Ctrl Enter>. TSEFile will then ask you which program should handle the
current file.


5.7 Finding Files and Text
--------------------------

If you want to locate some files, use the command File|Find. You have
four choices for the scope of the search:

    Current     searches only the current directory
    Local       recursively searches all subdirectories
    Drive       searches the entire current drive
    Global      searches all drives (Options|Drives)

At the filename prompt, which follows, you may enter an extended
wildcard specification of the file(s) you want to find. While searching,
TSEFile displays some statistics in a pop up window. When finished,
TSEFile will display either a message, that it could not find any files,
or it will pop up a list of all the files matching your specification.
Some of the basic file management commands are available from within this
list. (The target for copying files is the current directory.)

You can also locate files which contain a specified string of text or
regular expression (grep). The procedure is almost identical to finding
files by their names, except that you will additionally be asked to
enter some text, which the files must contain. Moreover, when viewing
one of the found files, you can "compress" it such, that only the lines
containing the search expression are visible.


5.8 File Descriptions
---------------------

TSEFile allows you to attach a description to a file. But you have to
use full screen mode (<F12>) to view and edit these descriptions. The
best thing about descriptions is, that they are sticky, which means they
will move along with their corresponding files, if these are moved or
copied. You can Copy (<Ctrl Ins>), Cut (<Shift Del>) and Paste (<Shift
Ins>) descriptions from one line of a directory listing to any other.
Additionally, you can attach the same description to all marked files
(Describe|Set_All_Marked) or to every file in the listing (Describe|
Set_All). To edit an existing description or to insert a new one, simply
press the <F2> key.

The descriptions are stored in a hidden file named "descript.ion", which
is compatible to the file of the same name which 4dos uses. In other
words the whole thing is stolen from this invaluable replacement of the
original DOS command interpreter.

(If you don't know what 4dos is or just haven't tried it, check it out!
It's a complete replacement for command.com made by JP Software, which
TMHO is a must have. It allows you to do all the things at the DOS
prompt you always wanted to do, but were afraid of to ask for.
Seriously, when working on some other person's PC, which does not have
4dos installed, makes me feel like being put into a straight jacket.)


5.9 Options
-----------

The options menu is used to customize the way TSEFile is working or to
temporarily have a different view of the directory listings. You can
determine which files should be shown in the listings (Left_List and
Right_List) and for which drives tree listings should be managed
(Drives). Moreover, you can sort the directory listings in a variety of
ways. All of these options can be written to disk (TSEFile.CFG) and will
be automatically reloaded the next time TSEFile is started.

If you do not like the colors I have chosen, you can alter these too.
All the colors used by TSEFile are defined right at the top of the
include file TSEFile.SRC. If you change these definitions, you must,
however, recompile _all_ the source files for your changes to take
effect.


6. Known (and Unknown) Problems
-------------------------------

This is an almost completely new version of TSEFile. Roughly 95% of the
source code is either new, extended or has changed in some way or
another. Since the basics have been tested over and over again during
program development, I am quite sure that there is no major bug hiding
in there. But I cannot guarantee that I found each and every minor
glitch. (You certainly know the age old saying: There's still another
bug!).

What I wanted to say is, if you should find a bug, have a suggestion on
what should be included in the next version, or just want to say hello,
send me a note. My CIS-ID is 100517.1221.

Actually, there is one known problem. When you pop up a menu from a pick
list in SAL, the mouse input is not handled correctly. The mouse cursor
and the menu highlight are offset by a fixed amount, which depends on
where the menu is placed. The only advice I have is, stick with the
keyboard whenever you see a blue menu.

Oh yes, I know, the documentation is incomplete, too short and
absolutely incomprehensible. But I'm afraid, there's nothing to be done
about it >-).
