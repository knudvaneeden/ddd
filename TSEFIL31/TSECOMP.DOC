1. What Is TSEComp?
-------------------

TSEComp compares text files. It is also capable of synchronizing the
compared files. For that purpose, it can search blocks of text, which
are present in only one of the two files, copy and delete those blocks
and copy and delete single lines.


2. Installation
---------------

See TSEFile.DOC for installation instructions.


3. Command Line Interface
-------------------------

TSEComp can be executed directly from the DOS command line. The command
line syntax is quite simple:

        TSEComp  First-File  Second-File.

TSEComp.BAT has a short help screen, which shows the above rules, if
you should ever forget them. Moreover, it tests, if the files actually
exist and tells you, if it cannot find one of the files.


4. Command Reference
--------------------

The following list contains a short description of all the commands
available in TSEComp. The key bindings and the keys used to access the
menu system are also included. This list is a verbatim copy of the help
screen of the program, which means that it is only a key stroke away,
when TSEComp is running.

5. Using TSEComp
----------------

On default TSEComp displays the files to be compared on a vertically
split screen. You can toggle to horizontally split windows using the
<Tab> key. You can move around using the cursor keys (including <PgUp>,
<PgDn>, <Home> and <End>). The 'unshifted' keys move the text in the
left (or upper) window. If you additionally press the <Ctrl> key, the
right (or lower) window is affected. If you want to move the text of
both windows simultaneously, use the <Alt> key instead. E.g., <Alt Home>
will position the highlights at the beginning of both files.

When TSEComp is started, it will immediately begin comparing the two
files and stop only when it encounters mismatching lines (or the end
of file marker in one of the files). Once TSEComp has stopped, you can
do a couple of things. To resume the comparison press <Enter>. If you
want a 'zoomed' view of the mismatching lines, hit the <SpaceBar> and a
window will pop up, which shows a detailed comparison of the two lines.
To update one of the lines with the other, use <Ctrl L> or <Ctrl R>.
To delete one of the lines, press <Ctrl D> and TSEComp will ask you
which one it should remove.

Things are a bit more complicated, when you encounter whole blocks of
text which are missing in one of the files. But TSEComp helps you to
find these. Use <Alt L> and <Alt R> to scan for blocks within the (l)eft
or (r)ight file. If you hit the wrong key, you can undo the search with
<Alt U>. <Alt B> and <Alt E> can be used to move to the beginning or end
of a marked block. Furthermore, a marked block can be copied over to the
other file using <Alt C>. If things should be even more complicated,
e.g., some parts of the files are completely different, you can use
<Alt F> to search for a line from which you want to resume comparing.

Finally, you can 'blank out' a set of characters (Compare|Filter).
TSEComp will completely ignore these characters. But you should be aware
that 'filtering' will slow down TSEComp considerably. Thus, you should
not use it unless it is absolutely necessary.


6. Why?
-------

TSEComp is similar to Cmp2BkUp, which is distributed with TSE. It misses
some of the features which Cmp2BkUp has, but has some additional goodies
of its own, like displaying a detailed comparison of two different
lines. Since there already was a file comparison macro, I did not intend
to publish the whole stuff. But when I included file comparison into
TSEFile, I found that it was easier to write an interface between macros
than to duplicate all the functionality. Since I did not want to flirt
with someone else's macro in public <grin>, I used my own instead. So,
that is the reason why you get second file comparison macro.
