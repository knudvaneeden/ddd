4 macros to help solve OCR scanning errors.

FuBookDu: Deletes duplicate scanned adjoining
          identical pages.

Ocr_bl  : Using a massive list of word pairs,
          it replaces consistenly badly
          scanned words with their correct
          counterparts without any
          interaction from the user. At the
          end, the macro generates a report,
          which can be consulted before the
          text file is saved.

2wrdlist: This is the macro to use, when the
          OCR software mixes up two words,
          that by themselves are perfectly
          correct. You add such word pairs to
          the 2wrdlist.wrd file, and let the
          macro search for occurrences of
          these words in the text file,
          giving the user the choice to
          easily swap each such word in the
          text file.

Goodcase: OCR software can have a problem
          determining the case of some
          letters: this macro solves such
          mistaken cases, using the
          surrounding letters to determine
          the correct case.
