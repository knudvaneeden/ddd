-
TseShell 0.99 allocates a buffer which
can be used almost like a normal editing
buffer, except that every line where the
"Enter" key is pressed at is interpreted
as a Dos command to be executed.
Commands can be "batched" by marking an
enclosing block and pressing "Enter"
(the Execute key). Program output will
end up in the command buffer, where it
can be edited and reused.
A help function is provided (an
adoptation and adaptation of DiK's
TseSHelp.S macro).
German and english language versions
included.
