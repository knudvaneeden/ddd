LoadFile.S Version  0.8/07-01-96
This macro modifies all file entry dialog boxes, providing
- a footer line showing command keys
- a pick file box
- another pick box for drives
German and english version provided.

No special preparations to the user interface are neccessary because all
functions hook themselves into the appropriate events, making the
macro's workings fully transparent. The additional features will be
available automatically upon installation. The pick file list will
always start up in the directory where the current file resides, or the
current directory for the drive, if no file is given.
