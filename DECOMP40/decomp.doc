1. Synopsis
-----------

The enclosed SAL macros allow you to edit your TSE-Pro (v2.5) and TSE
Pro-32 (v2.8, v3.0) keyboard macros. DeComp reads a binary keyboard
macro file and produces a readable key listing. This listing can be
altered and recompiled to binary format using ReComp. EditKbd can be
used to change the currently defined key macros on the fly.


3. Using DeComp and ReComp
--------------------------

Using DeComp and ReComp is simple and straight forward. If you made a
few typing errors while recording a keyboard macro, just save your work
on disk and execute DeComp. You are asked for the filename of the macro
file which should be decompiled. Enter the filename or press return and
choose it from the pick list. Now DeComp decompiles the binary file and
produces a readable list of the embedded macros and their respective
keystrokes. The list is automatically saved on disk and has the same
name as the binary file, but the extension kbd is replaced by k. The
keystrokes are dumped in the same format that SAL and the ShowKey macro
use. The decompiled macro contains one line per hotkey immediately
followed by the keystrokes (again one line per key). The keystrokes are
(and must be) indented.

After changing your typos you are ready to recompile the k-file. Just
run ReComp. If your current file has the extension k, ReComp assumes
that it is a macro listing and tries to compile it. Otherwise you are
prompted for a filename. If ReComp is satisfied with your listing, e.g.,
it did not find any format errors or unknown key codes, it saves the
binary file on disk. It also asks, whether it should immediately load the
embedded macro(s).

Both DeComp and ReComp display a progress report at the status line and
can be interrupted at any time by pressing the escape key.


3. Using EditKbd
----------------

EditKbd is even more convenient to use. It allows you to change the
currently defined key macros interactively and on the fly.

Execute EditKbd and it will decompile the currently defined key macros.
Next, it will present a list of keys which have key macros bound to
themselves. Using this list you can change a key <F2>, delete a macro
<Del> or add an all new macro <Ins>. Moreover, you can change the keys
of any macro you have previously recorded. Press <Enter> and a new list
will pop up which enumerates the recorded keys. Again you can delete
<Del> and insert <Ins> keys. To change a key press <Enter>. This opens a
prompt box which reads the new key.

Note:
The scrap macro is bound to the Enter key (c.f. section 4). Thus, if you
want to change the scrap macro, edit the <Enter> macro. If you want to
create an all new scrap macro, insert a macro and bind it to the Enter
key. This is due to the way key macros are stored on disk and has
nothing to do with the key that replays the scrap macro (<Ctrl Enter> in
the default key binding). By the way, you cannot assign a key macro to
<Enter> or <GreyEnter> anyway, which is due to the way the scrap macro
is recorded.

TSE Pro-32 only:
To change a key simply press the new key on your keyboard. This works
for almost any key or key combination. Exceptions are the basic list
navigation keys and the command keys. In this case you must explicitly
enter editing mode using <Enter>.

TSE Pro-32 v3.0 only:
Changes can be undone <Ctrl Z> and redone <Ctrl Y>. This works for both
the list of assigned keys and the list of recorded keys.

To finish editing a key macro press <Escape>. EditKbd asks, whether it
should save the changes you made and returns to the list of macro keys.
To quit the program press <Escape> a second time. EditKbd asks, whether
it should save the changes. Only if you answer yes, it will recompile
and load the changed key macros.


4. Key listing format
---------------------

A freshly decompiled key listing contains nothing but hotkeys, keystrokes
and a few blank lines to optically separate the macros. Yet a revised
listing ready for recompile may contain additional comments, to make your
work more productive. Blank lines and lines starting with a ";" are
ignored. Furthermore, ReComp also skips everything that follows the
closing angle bracket of a keystroke.

As already mentioned, hotkeys and keystrokes are listed in the SAL format.
This is the format which is used in the SAL language to assign macros and
commands to keys. The Appendix D of the TSE user's guide lists all the
possible key codes. If you wish to assign a macro to a key which SAL does
not recognize, you always can use the hexadecimal key code instead of its
textual representation. But be warned, ReComp checks only, if the key code
is within the range of 0 to 65535. It does not check, however, if the code
corresponds to a real key on your keyboard. You should use the ShowKey
macro to check for key codes and their names used in SAL.

There is one important exception to the these rules. This is the hotkey
of the scrap macro, which is always listed as <Enter> or <GreyEnter>.
The Enter and GreyEnter keys are the only choices you have to initiate
the recording of this macro. One final comment about the scrap macro.
This macro will always be listed last in the output of DeComp, due to
its position in the binary macro file. During a recompile, however, its
position is immaterial, because ReComp will put it in the correct place
anyway.

Each macro is terminated by a key you did not record. In the standard
user interface this key will be <Ctrl M>, which is used to start and
stop macro recording. Please heed the advice, which is included on these
lines of the DeComp output, and do not alter these lines. The reason is,
that the keystroke used to terminate macro recording _is_ included in
the binary macro file, but it is _not_ replayed. You could safely delete
these lines, however, because TSE will not miss them after you have
recompiled the macros. But for compatibility's sake just leave them as
they are, because only the key to which the RecordKeyMacro command is
bound will be ignored by TSE. DeComp and ReComp cannot handle this issue
by themselves, as there is no way to determine which key is bound to the
RecordKeyMacro command from within a SAL macro.

Here is a more formal description of what a key listing may contain.

    þ Blank line
        ù These lines are ignored.
    þ Comment line
        ù Each line beginning with a ";" is a comment line.
        ù These lines are ignored
    þ Inline comments
        ù Each key definition may be followed by arbitrary
          characters (the comment).
        ù These characters are ignored.
    þ HotKey
        ù This is a valid TSE key definition, which must have
          its opening angle bracket placed in the first column
          of a line.
        ù This line initiates the compilation of a macro and
          terminates the previous macro.
        ù A hotkey must be followed by at least one key stroke.
    þ KeyStroke
        ù This is a valid TSE key definition, which must be
          indented by one or more spaces.
        ù This key definition is appended as key stroke to
          the current macro.
    þ Termination Key (optional)
        ù This is a valid TSE key definition, which must be
          indented by one or more spaces.
        ù This must be the key to which the RecordKeyMacro
          command is bound.
        ù This key is the last key of a macro, e.g., the key
          definition immediately prior to a hotkey definition,
          and will not be replayed during execution of the macro.


5.) Error Messages
------------------

a) EditKbd
    þ No key macros defined!
        You can't edit key macros unless you have recorded
        at least one of them.
    þ Duplicate macro hot key
        The hot key of macro must be unique. Retry and
        choose another hot key.
    þ Maximum macro capacity reached!
        You cannot define more than 20 key macros.
    þ Cannot execute macro
        EditKbd was unable to find DeComp or ReComp
    þ Error while decompiling key macros.
        Something went wrong while DeComp was executing.
        Save your key macro and try to manually decompile
        them using DeComp to see what's amiss.
    þ Cannot find key macro! Key list is invalid!
        You tried to edit a k-file which isn't actually a
        key listing or managed to damage the key listing.
        Try using ReComp to zoom in on the error.

b) DeComp
    þ Invalid macro file format
        There is either a version conflict or the file is not a
        TSE macro file at all.
    þ Terminated by user
        You interrupted DeComp by pressing the <Escape> key.

c) ReComp
    þ Macro is empty
        A macro must contain at least one keystroke. Probably you
        forgot to intend one or more of the keystroke definitions.
    þ Scrap macro defined more than once
        Each macro file can store only one scrap macro, because
        you can have only one scrap macro defined at a time.
        Delete the surplus definitions.
    þ Too many macros
        A macro file can store up to twenty macros (not counting
        the scrap macro). Move some of the macros to another file.
    þ Invalid key code
        ReComp does not recognize what is inside the angle brackets
        of a key definition. Most probably there is a typo in the
        key name.
    þ Invalid macro format
        The current line is neither blank nor a comment nor does
        it contain a key definition. Most probably you forgot to
        type the comment character (;) or you misspelled one of the
        angle brackets of the key definition. This is also triggered,
        if your first macro misses the hotkey.
    þ Terminated by user
        You interrupted ReComp by pressing the <Escape> key.

There are some more error messages, but you probably will never see
them, because they handle buffer allocation errors and thus will be
triggered only, if there is a severe shortage of memory.


6.) National Keyboards
----------------------

(This section applies to TSE v2.5 only. These macros do not need and do
not use a translation table when compiled for the 32-bit versions of the
editor.)

DeComp and ReComp will work fine with the US keyboard layout. But if
you are a non-US resident, you will sometimes find odd numbers instead
of key names in the output of DeComp. This is not an error, but is due
to the different keyboard layout you are using (compared to the US-
keyboard). By the way, the ShowKey macro will also refuse to produce the
correct key names. This is perfectly o.k., however, because ShowKey is
intended to show the names of the keys as TSE recognizes them.

But when you are using DeComp and ReComp, you want to see the names of
the keys you actually typed and not some odd numbers, which TSE thinks
you used. The macros use a table to translate numerical key codes to key
names and vice versa. This table is stored in the file keytable.dat and
is only correct for the US-keyboard. Well, I am German and use a German
keyboard, of course. Therefore, DeComp would produce one of those odd
numbers every once and awhile for myself, if I had not adapted the
aforementioned translation table to the German keyboard layout. This is
good news for all German users of TSE, because the only thing they have
to do, is to copy the file keytable.049 over keytable.dat, and every-
thing will work just fine.

I am sorry, that I cannot provide any other translation tables, because
I do not own any foreign keyboards, which are essential in producing
these tables. But perhaps there are a few people out there, who
volunteer for this tedious work and who are willing to share it with
their compatriots.


7.) Some Historical and Technical Details
-----------------------------------------

As a long time user of TSE Jr. (no, not anymore, I am now using TSE
instead), I always appreciated that TSE Jr. feature which allowed you to
decompile and edit your keyboard macros. I terribly missed this one in
TSE. So quite a while ago I decided to have a closer look at the
keyboard macro files which TSE produces. It did not take too long to
figure out most of the file format and I was able to write preliminary
versions of the programs you are now reading about. As these macros use
undocumented information, which I admittedly have hacked, I decided to
first privately ask the people at SemWare about their opinion on this
project. Sammy Mitchell's answer was not only encouraging, but he also
filled in some of the information about the keyboard macro format I had
missed. Now here is, what I currently know about TSE's keyboard macros.

TSE keyboard macros are stored in a system buffer. Since lines of a
buffer have a finite length and since keyboard macros may be larger than
that, a single macro can span multiple lines. This fact is reflected in
the way macros are stored in a file. A keyboard macro file consists of a
file header and the stored macros. The file header includes, among other
things, the hot keys, the total number of macros stored and the number
of lines occupied by the macros. The specific format is as follows.

    a) "Magic Header" (18 bytes)
        This part of the macro file is constant. It is presumably used
        to check, if the loaded file really is a keyboard macro file.
        The forth word (offset 7) seems to be the version number of TSE.
        DeComp checks on this, before it tries to decompile a file.

    b) "??????" (24 bytes or 32 bytes)
        This is the part of the macro file header, I was unable and
        unwilling to figure out, after I had realized that I could fill
        in some information extracted from a "real" macro file and
        everything worked fine. Moreover it is not necessary to know
        what is in there, to successfully decompile a macro file.

    c) Hotkeys (42 bytes)
        This is an array of 21 words, which contains the hotkeys of the
        macros or NULL's for the unused slots. The last word is reserved
        for the scrap macro.

    d) Line Pointers (42 bytes)
        This is an array of 21 words, which contains 'pointers' to the
        macros or NULL's for the unused slots. These pointer are in fact
        the line numbers of the first line of each macro. Again, the
        last word is reserved for the scrap macro.

    e) Macro Count (2 bytes)
        This is the total count of the macros stored in the macro file.
        (Does not include the scrap macro.)

    f) Line Count (2 bytes)
        This is the total count of the lines used to store the macros.
        (Includes continuation lines and the scrap macro.)

The keystrokes of the macros are stored immediately following the file
header. There is one entry per line used to store the macros in the
system buffer, in which they are loaded. This means one entry for short
macros and multiple entries for macros which exceed MaxLineLen
characters. The format of each entry is as follows.

    a) Size of Entry N (2 bytes)
        This is the size of the current line in bytes. N includes the
        continuation flag, but not the size word itself. Its values are
        in the range 4..MaxLineLen and are even numbers, of course.
    b) Continuation Flag (2 bytes)
        This flag indicates, if the macro is continued on the following
        line. The coding is as follows
                0x0000  this is the last or only line
                0xFFFF  one or more continuation lines follow
    c) The Keystrokes (N-2 bytes)
        Keystrokes are stored in hex format. The low byte is the ascii
        code and the high byte is the scan code. Usually the last key of
        a macro will be the key used to terminate recording (<Ctrl M> in
        the standard user interface). This key will not be replayed, if
        (and only if) it is the RecordKeyMacro command.

Finally, you should notice that all this information is version
dependent. Which means, that things might change with future versions
of TSE.
