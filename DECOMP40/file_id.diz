<06-05-01> v4.00 replaces v3.4 dated 05-14-01
This package includes SAL macros, which allow
you to edit your TSE-Pro v2.5 and TSE Pro/32
key macros.  DeComp reads a binary keyboard
macro file and produces a readable key
listing.  This listing can be altered and
recompiled to binary format using ReComp.
EditKbd can be used to change the currently
defined key macros on the fly.
