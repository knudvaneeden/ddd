    CodePad - Line up code nicely into columns

    1. INTRODUCTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    This is a simple code formatting macro that lets you easily align
    many similar lines of code so that all of the punctuation lines up.

    For instance, with a single keypress CodePad turns this:

        integer Grapes = 5439
        integer Pinapples = 15
        integer Raspberries = 2
        integer Pips = 3

    into this:

        integer Grapes      = 5439
        integer Pinapples   = 15
        integer Raspberries = 2
        integer Pips        = 3

    CodePad can pad around other punctuation as well.  It can convert this
    Perl code from:

        $berry = 'Grapes' if $fruit_id == 432;
        $legume = 'Lima Beans' if $veg_id == 40;
        $fruit = 'Grapefruit' if $fruit_id == 1;

    Into something more readable:

        $berry  = 'Grapes'     if $fruit_id == 432;
        $legume = 'Lima Beans' if $veg_id == 40;
        $fruit  = 'Grapefruit' if $fruit_id == 1;

    Or, by using the interactive function (Pad('')), you can pad
    around the '==' expressions as well:

        $berry  = 'Grapes'     if $fruit_id == 432;
        $legume = 'Lima Beans' if $veg_id   == 40;
        $fruit  = 'Grapefruit' if $fruit_id == 1;

    2. INSTALLATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE: On TSE 2.5 (DOS) You will first need to install the Profile
    package.  See Profile.txt in that package for instructions.

    Place the CodePad.s, findprof.si and setcache.si files in
    your macro source directory, then compile CodePad.s.

    Note that the findprof.si and setcache.si files may already have
    been installed from another macro package. If so, you should not
    need to install them again.  But it's worth taking a quick check
    to see that you have the latest version of these files.

    There are two basic functions in CodePad (described in the next section).

    You can bind keys to these functions directly by editing the CodePad.s
    source file:

        <Ctrl g><d> AutoPad()
        <Ctrl g><s> Pad('')

    or you can make bindings in your UI file:

        <Ctrl g><d> ExecMacro('CodePad -f')
        <Ctrl g><s> ExecMacro('CodePad')

    If you bind directly to the functions, you should place CodePad
    in TSE's autoload list, so that the functions are always available.

    3. USAGE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    The Pad() function (Also: ExecMacro('CodePad')) is used
    to align lines in a marked block around a particular punctuation
    character or characters.

    Pass the character or characters as a parameter, e.g.:

        Pad('=')   // Line up around equals signs
        Pad(',')   // Line up around commas

    If you want the macro to use multiple passes to align around
    more than one character or string, specify these by whitespace:

        Pad(', ;')  // Pad around commas and semi-colons
        Pad('= //') // Pad around equals or comments

    When called with a blank string,

        Pad('') // Ask for what to pad around

    In this case the function will prompt you for the character or
    characters it should pad around.  (The default for this function, as
    well as the history for the prompt are configurable.  See below
    under CONFIGURATION.)

    The AutoPad() function analizes the current line, and all
    the lines above and below it, trying to find common characters to
    pad around.  You do not need to mark the lines first, and it does
    not prompt for the characters to pad around.

    It is a convenient function, but please note that it can occasionally
    do strange things depending upon the text you give it.

    3. CONFIGURATION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    CodePad reads its settings from TSE.INI.  (It searches for this file
    according to the rules in the FindProf package.)  CodePad uses the
    [CodePad] section of TSE.INI.

    You can specify the characters to pad around for the following cases:

         Set used by AutoPad():

             full_pad_set

         Sets in Pad() history:

             default_pad_set1
             default_pad_set2
             default_pad_set3
             default_pad_set4
             default_pad_set5

    The defaults for these settings are as follows:

        full_pad_set         = => ) if # ,
        default_pad_set1     =
        default_pad_set2     =>
        default_pad_set3     )
        default_pad_set4     ) = =>
        default_pad_set5

    CodePad will use the SetCache package if you have it installed.
    This means you can tell it to reload its settings without exiting it
    and restarting.  To do so, Edit TSE.INI, and then run the SReload macro.
