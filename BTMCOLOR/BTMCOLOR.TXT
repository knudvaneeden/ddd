BTMCOLOR.TSE

4DOS is a replacement MS-DOS command processor from JP Software; NDOS is a 
private label version of 4DOS sold by Symantec as part of the Norton 
Utilities.  One of the best features of 4DOS (and NDOS) is vastly more 
powerful and faster running batch files.  This template enables color editing 
of 4DOS/NDOS batch files (4DOS 5.5, NDOS 7.0, MS-DOS 6.2).

The ".btm" suffix stands for "batch to memory", a 4DOS option for speeding 
batch file processing by reading the entire file into memory before executing 
it.  This template will also colorize .bat files if you add the lines: 

   when ".btm", ".bat"
       s = ".btm"

to the mResolveGroupExtensions proc in colors.s.

The template assigns colors as follows:

White   - Most internal 4DOS/NDOS commands.
Yellow  - If...then...else commands; comparison operators; labels.
Red     - Most symbols; transfer of control commands such as for, do,
          until, while, goto, gosub, return, call.
Green   - External MS-DOS commands & utilities; numbers.
Magenta - 4DOS/NDOS internal variables & variable functions;
          paired internal commands such as pushd/popd and text/endtext.
Grey    - Remarks.


I hope you like this and find it useful.  Please write to me with any
