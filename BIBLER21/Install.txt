      How to install and/or customize the macro

1. Installation
   Copy BibleRes.s to your macro directory, compile it
   if you wish (the supplied .mac was compiled with
   TSE 4.4 on Windows XP with all updates applied)
   Copy KJV.txt to wherever you want it, default C:\Bible
   Open KJV.txt in TSE editor, execute macro BibleRes
   Files created while running (Hits.txt, Verses.txt)
   will be created in the same directory as KJV.txt


2. Customization
   A. Line length:
      shipped with KJV.txt wrapped to 60 char wide - if you
      want to change this, included is a macro "ReWrap" you
      can compile and use - will leave the verse address
      line as-is, then wrap the text of the verse to whatever
      you have your margins set

   B. Fonts and Bullets:
      The original BibleRes used upper-ascii characters for
      bullets - I have always used "Letter Gothic Line"
      since the gui versions of TSE were first released -
      but it seems a lot of people now use "Courier New" or
      other fonts that do not have the same upper-ascii
      characters - so I used Courier New for this version,
      and very common keyboard characters for bullets - by
      the way, the bullets serve very important functions in
      the operation of the Bible Research macro - so you are
      free to change them to whatever you wish, but _some_
      bullet characters have to be there for the macro to
      work - when you change a bullet, you must change it
      every place it occurs, in the KJV.txt file, Bullets.s,
      and the BibleRes macro, then recompile them - a
      simple replace operation in the editor will work, as
      long as you do it in ALL the files - while we're at
      it, there is something that needs to be retained, the
      "section separator" that appears in the hits.text file
      that looks like this:  -=<>=-  without this, the menu
      items alt + 6, 7, and 8 (which allow you to jump from
      the hits list to the verse in the KJV, move around and
      read the context as much as you wish, then return to
      the hits list and move to the next hit) will not work
      - once again, you can replace this, but _something_
      has to be there

3. What if something doesn't work?
      While I have tested this macro repeatedly, and
      intentionally made mistakes and entered wrong characters
      when asked for a book name abbreviation, it _seems_ to
      be bug-free at this time.  But if you find a bug that I
      missed, contact me and I will do my best to fix the
      problem.

4. If you need help in the areas of installation or
   customization, I will try to help you with that as well.
