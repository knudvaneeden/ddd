BibleRes2.1  TSE Bible Research Program
A simple, yet powerful, set of tools
that allows you to search for words or
phrases, to gather together Scripture
passages for further use, or to move
quickly to a specified verse.  This is
a complete re-write that fixes bugs, and
allows newer fonts and more common bullet
characters.  The included KJV.txt can be
rewrapped to any length (macro included)
and all bullets and keybindings can be
changed to suit your personal taste.
