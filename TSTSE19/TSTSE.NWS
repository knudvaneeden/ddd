Sat 17-May-97: I have updated my collection of the SemWare editor
macros to be
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tstse19.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor version 2.5
Rewrote the macro "FLIPONE.S Flip one character, incl foreign" to
jump to the beginning of the next word after the character has been
flipped. Also (hopefully) corrected a bug that made wrong
conversions if a block was on in the window.
   Rewrote macro "TOASC.S Scandinavian 7/8-bit conversions" adding
more conversions. The adjustments include e.g. the general-interest
HTML foreign character conversions. They now cover the whole range.
   Rewrote macro "HP500.S Esc sequences, HP DeskJet 500". It now has
the options to either send the escape sequences (new) to the printer
or to insert them into the text. Rewrote in a similar manner the
macro "DICONIX.S Esc seqs, Diconix InkJet 150".
   Rewrote macro "UPCASE.S Convert text to upper/lower case" to
handle also the cases of convert word and convert line besides
convert block and entire file. The conversions handle also foreign
characters like a" and o".


Wed 28-Feb-96: I have made an update
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tstse18.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor version 2.5
Added
 "BOXTOASC Box drawing chars to 7-bit ASCII"
 "DUMP.S Dump block as bin oct dec or hex"
 "ROTATE.S Copy column to row or vice versa"
The rotate macro collection also includes the option to reverse a
range of text. Furthermore, made the following improvements to
 "TOASC.S Scandinavian 7/8-bit conversions"
 - added the option between a block and entire file conversion
 - the choice also adds confirmation
 - included some more characters into the conversion
 - improved the help screen
Corrected a minor typo in
 "RNGEFIND.S Forward search an ascii range"
Added to
 "MISC.S Miscellaneous SAL macros"
a macro that reloads the current file without saving the changes
that may have been made since last saving the file. This is a
convenient method one can use to undo the recent changes in a file
in the editor window. This is an often needed very useful procedure.
   A demonstration version of the SemWare editor is available as
 404275 Dec 14 1994 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/demo/tsetd2.zip
 tsetd2.zip The SemWare Editor (TSE) v2.0 Demo/Test-Drive
Well, how come all these macros for the TSE editor? Simple, I have
needed the operations also for my own editing purposes at one stage
or another. You see, TSE v2.5 (and MicroEMACS on Unix) are the
editors I use the most. For example, just the other day I needed to
rotate a column into a row, and to dump a row in decimal.

Sun 28-Jan-96: I have made an update
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tstse17.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor version 2.5
Upon getting an update of the SemWare Editor from version 2.0 to
version 2.5 I have gone through my collection of SAL macros to
enhance the editor. There have been some changes in the SAL language
from version 2.0 to version 2.5 which are reflected in my update.
If you have TSE 2.0 then do not get my update. If you have 2.5, then
please do, since not all the old macros will continue to work
without the changes. Furthermore, I made the following changes
1) Rewrote and renamed SWITCH.S to SWAP.S
 "SWAP.S Swap order of text, words/chars"
2) Added "Run TurboPower Software Structure Analyst on the current
file" to "PROGS.S Run programs on the editor text".

Sun 12-Nov-95: I have made an update
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tstse16.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor
1) Wrote a new macro file
 "UPCASE.S Convert text to upper/lower case"
This set handles extended ascii set including a' a" and o", that is
the Scandinavian characters. The SemWare Editor standard includes
an upper / lower case conversion, but it does not cover the foreign
characters.
2) Added macros for inserting escape sequences for several printers.
These help give the editor some features of a true wordprocessor.
The new macros are
 "DICONIX.S Esc seqs, Diconix InkJet 150"
 "HP500.S   Esc sequences, HP DeskJet 500"
Even if you don't have any of these printers, if you understand the
TSE macro language, it should not be too difficult to adapt to
yours.
3) Made a correction in
 "COUNT.S Count block lines, words, chars"
where one of the menu items gave a wrong command.
4) Added a "working..." message to
 "DETAB.S Detab a line or the entire file"
since detabbing a large file can take some time.
5) Added in PROS.S a routine
 "Run a Turbo Pascal source"
to
 "PROGS.S Run programs on the editor text"

Sat 29-Jul-95: Updated
 ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/ts/tstse15.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor
Added in its macro
 "TOASC.S Scandinavian 7/8-bit conversions"
conversions between Scandinavian html characters used in preparing
World Wide Web files. Added a new macro
 "LINE.S Insert line numbers"

Fri 31-Mar-95: I have updated my collection of The SemWare Editor
macros to be
 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/ts/tstse14.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor
Added three new marcos
 NOBLANK.S Remove blank lines from file or block
 SWITCH.S  Switch order of text
 DETAB.S   Detab a line or the file
Updated
 TOASC.S   Scandinavian 7/8-bit conversions

Sat 18-Feb-95: After releasing a new version of my macro collection
for The SemWare Editor I got very useful feedback from Michael Bate
(mbb@crl.com) reporting a factual nonfunctionality of the macro
 "ROT13.S Rotate text by 13 positions"
I have rewritten this macro and hopefully it works correctly now. I
have also rewritten
 "TOASC.S Scandinavian 7/8-bit conversions"
to handle the Unix / IBM PC Scandinavian character conversions since
the new convention by the Finnish computer centres of using Latin1
character set on Unix nodes.
The updated version is available as
 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/ts/tstse13.zip

Sun 12-Feb-95: I have updated my macro collection for my favorite
MS-DOS editor The SemWare Editor.
 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/ts/tstse12.zip
 SAL macro sources to extend The SemWare Editor
I have added the following material
 "COUNT.S Count block lines, words, characters, like Unix wc"
 "RULER.S Relative, absolute or centered ruler on screen"
The macros are self-documenting. A demonstration version of the
SemWare editor is available as tsedt2.zip from Garbo's /pc/demo/
directory.

Sun 15-Jan-95: I have updated my collection of macros for the
SemWare Editor, v. 2.0. You can find a demo version of the said
editor as
 404275 Dec 14 02:00 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/demo/tsetd2.zip
 tsetd2.zip The SemWare Editor (TSE) v2.0 Demo/Test-Drive
I added the following macro
  "RNGEFIND.S Forward search an ascii range"
The reason for this addition is the following. I needed for my own
purposes to check in a converted file whether it has any 8-bit
characters because there isn't supposed to be any in the file.
   The updated package is garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/ts/tstse11.zip.

Tue 29-Nov-94: Started a collection of macros for the SemWare
Editor, v. 2.0. This is the editor that I use on MS-DOS most of the
time. The editor is an extension of the QEdit editor.
