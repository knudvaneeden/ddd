  A 3d TSE v.2 OS/2 icon.  Time has passed
and the old, flat icons are passe.  Here is
an update to the Tessie monster icon I posted
so long ago. I hope all of you, including
Richard B., like it!
  You don't use OS/2?  For shame!
  To SemWare, permission granted to include
it with TSE, if you wish.
