1. Synopsis
-----------

TseShExt includes files and macros which allow you to tightly integrate
TSE32 (v2.8 or later) into the Windows 95/98 and NT4 shell. This includes
additional context menu entries and a shell new entry for some editor
related file types.


2. What's New
-------------

Version 2 has been redesigned from ground up. Configuring and installing
the shell extensions is now wrapped into an installation program. The latter
queries options, generates an inf file and installs the new settings. This
makes manually editing an inf file unnecessary. Moreover, this version
allows you to add "Open With TSE" entries to existing associations. See
OpenWith.doc for details.


3. Installation
---------------

Installing the TSE shell extension is simple and straight forward.

(1) Copy the files to some temporary folder. It is essential that the name
    of this folder doesn't include any spaces, otherwise the INF interpreter
    of Windows 95 will fail.

(2) Make sure that both E32.EXE and SC32.EXE are found on your path. Run the
    INSTALL batch file and choose whatever options you want from the menu.
    C.f. section 5 to see what each options does. Finally, choose install
    and close the dialog. If you find that the install option is disabled,
    try uninstalling the package first.

(3) NEVER (o.k. unless you know exactly what you're doing) change the files
    within the folder TseShExt, because this might disable the uninstall
    feature of this package.

If the installation routine should terminate with an error message, upgrade
your copy of TSE to version 2.8. A free patch that upgrades version 2.6 to
version 2.8 is available at SemWare's web site. The shell extensions do not
work with the DOS version of TSE (version 2.5 or earlier).


4. Un-Installing
----------------

Run the install utility and choose uninstall in the menu. Alternatively,
open the software control panel and search for the "Tse Shell Extensions"
entry. Highlight it and click the Add/Remove button... Finished.


5. Using the TSE Shell Extensions
---------------------------------

Using this package is the easiest part. After installation the windows shell
and explorer include some new file types and associations, e.g. you can
double click an associated file in the explorer and thereby start TSE and
and simultaneously load the file. Furthermore, these files also have
additional entries added to their context menus within the explorer, e.g.
"print", "compile", etc.

Using "print" from the explorer's context menu will let you choose between
two printer setups, namely "Small Font" and "Large Font" (you can also abort
the print job entirely). The catch is, that neither I nor the macro which
initiates the print job know what brand of printer you own. The macro
assumes it is controlling a HP-LaserJet. I don't know, whether the init
strings will work with other printers (Well, at least I know that it does
not work with IBM Proprinters.) If your printer should get the hiccups when
using TSE to print files from the shell, you must adapt the initialization
strings in the ShPrint macro. Consult the documentation of your printer
which escape and control sequences are required.

Here's a short list of the file types and their corresponding extension
which are created by this package.

file type           ext     default action    install option
---------           ---     --------------    --------------
TSE Text File       (1)     load file         Associate TSE Text Files
"unknown files"     (2)     load file         Open Unknown Files with TSE
TSE Project         dat     restore state     Restore State from Explorer
Macro               s       load file         Macro Language Package
Macro Include       si      load file         ditto
User Interface      ui      load file         ditto
Compiled Macro      mac     execute macro     ditto
Dialog Script       d       execute DE (3)    Dialogs Library Package
Dialog Resource     dlg     execute DD (3)    ditto

(1) user defined file extensions
(2) c.f. next paragraph
(3) dialogs macro package (available at SemWare's FTP site)

The installation macro can create additional associations for the "unknown"
file type. This file type is responsible for the "Open With" dialog which
pops up whenever you double click a file whose type Window doesn't
recognize. The first of the new entries "Open" loads the file into TSE as a
text file. This also becomes the new default action, the one which is
executed by double clicking the file. The other new entry loads the file in
binary mode (-h -b16 switches). You can still use the "Open With" dialog:
right click the file and choose "Open With" from the context menu.

The installation macro also allows you to define "TSE Text Files". These
will be associated with TSE and accordingly marked in the Windows shell. To
do this you have to set the option "Associate TSE Text Files" to ON and add
some file extensions to "Extensions for Text Files". You can customize the
default extensions shown in the dialog by editing the file INSTALL.DAT.
