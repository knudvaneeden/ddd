1. Synopsis
-----------

The OpenWith macro allows you to insert an additional "Open With TSE" entry
into the shell's context menu of an existing file type.


2. What's New (Version 2.10)
----------------------------

Tried to enhance the user friendliness of the macro ;-).

þ menu caption of "Open With TSE" entry may now be customized
þ macro now displays the file type the same way the windows explorer does
þ enhanced information display for current file type
þ added refresh command
þ fixed some bugs (quoting of filenames, error handling)

When run for the first time, the new version will updated existing shell
entries to the new format automatically.


3. Installation
---------------

Creating the "Open With TSE" entries is simple and straight forward.

Make sure that both E32.EXE and SC32.EXE are found on your path and run the
OpenWith batch file. This will extract a list of existing file types from
the windows registry for you to edit.

Each line of the generated list displays a file type and its associated file
extensions. Press <Ins> to add an "Open With TSE" entry to the windows
shell. <F3> searches and lists all "Open With TSE" entries. Use <Enter> to
display more information for the current file type. The list cannot be
edited. To change these entries use the windows explorer.

If the installation routine should terminate with an error message, upgrade
your copy of TSE to version 2.8. A free patch that upgrades version 2.6 to
version 2.8 is available at SemWare's web site. The shell extensions do not
work with the DOS version of TSE (version 2.5 or earlier).


4. Un-Installing
----------------

Run the OpenWith batch file, pop up the menu <F10> and choose Uninstall.
This will remove all existing "Open With TSE" entries from the registry.


5. Using the Shell Extensions
-----------------------------

To use the "Open With TSE" menu entry, right click an associated file
within the explorer. The context menu now let's you open the file with TSE.
This is in addition to and does not interfere with any previously existing
menu entry.

An example: TXT files are usually associated with notepad. If you double
click them or choose Open from the context menu, notepad will be opened
and load the respective file. Now if you add an "Open With TSE" entry to
the textfile file type, you can right click any TXT file and choose to
open it with TSE.
