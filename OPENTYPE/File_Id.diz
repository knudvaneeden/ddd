(Sep 4, 2005) - OpenType 1.3 for TSE Pro 4.4 upwards.
When opening a file don't get a fixed list of filetypes
but get a list of filetypes based on TSE's history.
You can set a filetype TSE should always start with.
You can group filetypes on their program association.
OpenType is only effective when the TSE-option
Use Common File Dialogs is ON.
