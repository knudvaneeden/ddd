TSGREP reads files, prepares a list of lines
that have a search string, and lets you go
back and forth between the list and files.
Includes across_line_search, use of -or- and
-and- in searh, recursive search of sub-
directories. Regular expressions *optional*.
Can include up to 9 lines around each find.
Can exclude files by date or extension. This
is a fast and powerful GREP utility that
extends TSE's regular expression searching.
Menu or command line driven.
     v6.5 ... faster ... for TSE 2.5.
