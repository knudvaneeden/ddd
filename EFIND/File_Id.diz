(Jul 1, 2007) - eFind v2.0.2 for TSE Pro v2.5e upwards.
This macro allows you to search in a gigantic amount of files.
TSE lets you open more files than fit in memory, and then this macro can
search across them without running into the memory limit.
It can also keep or abandon files which contain a certain string: you can do
this multiple times to step by step zero in on a selection of files.
v2.0.2 Improves the warning if too many files were opened.
