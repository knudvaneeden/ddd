                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

  Template mode is a versatile and powerful feature that allows you to
  minimize typing when entering repetitive text or generating text in a
  pre-defined structure.  With this feature, an abbreviated text string
  is identified as a "keyword" and assigned to a user-defined template
  of expanded text.  Template mode operates by expanding the abbreviated
  text (the keyword) into the text defined in the associated template.

  Templates can be useful for entering long words or phrases that you
  use often, such as your name or your address.  They can also be used
  to create "forms" for guiding the entry of text according to a
  pre-defined format.  Simply assign the expanded text (the template) to
  the abbreviation (keyword) of your choice.  The next time you want to
  include your name or address in a document, or insert a text-entry
  form into a file, just type the assigned keyword and press the
  template-expansion key.  The editor replaces the abbreviation with the
  text defined in the template.

  To create a template for any regular construct, such as "if" or
  "while" statements.  A number of templates are included in the editor
  for C, Pascal, xBase, and SemWare's macro language (SAL).

  A number of Template options are available, allowing you to:

    ù display a PickList of templates in the Template "dictionary" (from
    which you can expand, add, or delete a template)

    ù expand a keyword into text defined in a template

    ù create your own template and add it to the Template "dictionary"

    ù delete an existing template from the Template "dictionary"

  Templates that you create are saved by the editor, and are available
  during each editing session.

  You can define templates as either local or global.  A local template
  is readily available only for a specified file extension; a global
  template is readily available for all file extensions.


Basic Operation of Template Mode
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  To toggle Template mode ON and OFF, choose "Template Expansion" under
  the Util Menu.  To use Template mode, you must toggle it ON.

  When Template mode is ON, the <Tab> and <Ctrl Tab> keys are configured
  to perform special Template operations.  <Tab> expands a
  template-defined keyword into its pre-assigned word, phrase, or series
  of lines.  (If the cursor is not positioned at the end of a
  Template-defined keyword when you press <Tab>, the <Tab> key behaves
  as normal; that is, it executes the TabRight command.) Pressing <Ctrl
  Tab> pops up the Template menu.

  The simplest way to invoke Template expansion for a keyword in your
  text is as follows:

    ù Place the cursor at the end of the keyword; that is, one position past
      the last character, as it would be if you had just typed the keyword.
      (If the cursor is positioned within a word, the characters in the word
      to the immediate left of the cursor will be used as the keyword.)

    ù Press <Tab>.

  The editor then searches for a (case-insensitive) match in the
  Template dictionary for the keyword before the cursor.  If one is
  located (and is available to the file extension of the current file),
  the keyword is replaced with the expanded text from the Template
  dictionary.  Existing text in the file is shifted to accommodate the
  text inserted from the template. If the keyword is not located (or is
  not available to the current file extension), the <Tab> key behaves
  according to its normal action.

  When the expanded text is inserted in the current file, the cursor is
  positioned at the end of the expanded text by default.  However, you
  can specify a particular position in the expanded text on which you
  want the cursor to be located instead.  You can even temporarily turn
  on Insert mode for the line on which the cursor is initially
  positioned.  (These capabilities are described below under "Creating
  Your Own Template.")

  To perform other Template operations, use the Template menu.  To
  access the Template menu, press <Ctrl Tab>.  The Template menu
  provides alternate methods for expanding keywords.  It also allows you
  to add, delete, or list templates in the Template dictionary.  These
  options are described in the following sections.


Creating Your Own Template
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

It is quite easy to create your own template, as illustrated by the following:

    ù Type the text as you want it to appear when it is fully expanded.

    ù If desired, specify the location at which you want the cursor to be
      positioned by placing "\c" (without the quotes) at the desired location
      in the text.  By default, if you do not indicate a cursor position, the
      cursor is placed at the end of the expanded text when the template is
      inserted.

    ù If you want to force Insert mode ON for the cursor line when the
      template is inserted, place "\C" (uppercase, without the quotes) at the
      desired location of the cursor.  When the template is inserted, the
      cursor will be positioned at the location indicated by the placement of
      "\C".  If Insert mode is OFF, it will be set ON until you move the
      cursor off this cursor line.  (Once the cursor moves from this line,
      Insert mode is set back OFF, if it was OFF when the template was
      initially expanded.)

    ù Next mark the expanded text using one of the block-marking commands.

    ù Press <Ctrl Tab> to display the Template menu.

    ù Add the currently-marked text to the Template dictionary, either by:

      ù Selecting "Add Marked Text as Template" from the Template menu; or

      ù Selecting "List Templates (Add/Delete/Expand)" from the Template menu,
        then pressing <Ins> once the PickList of Templates is displayed.

      In either case, the editor prompts you for the keyword to which to
      assign the template.  The case of the keyword is not significant.  This
      keyword should be unique, simple to type, and easy to remember!  If you
      select a keyword that is already in the Template dictionary, you will be
      given the option to add a duplicate entry, replace the existing entry,
      or cancel the operation.  Duplicate entries can be helpful if you want
      to use the same keyword for different template expansions, depending on
      the extension of the file.

      The editor then prompts you for an extension.

      ù If you want to limit the immediate availability of the template to a
        particular file extension (making it a local template), type the
        desired filename extension, and press <Enter>.

      ù If you want to make the template readily available for all file
        extensions (making it a global template), clear the prompt box (press
        the space bar if the prompt box input area is not empty), and press
        <Enter>.

  Once a template is added, the editor is updated so that the template
  is available each time you start the editor.


Alternate Methods for Expanding a Template
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  In addition to using the <Tab> key to expand a keyword (as described
  under "Basic Operation of Template Mode" above), two other expansion
  methods are available from the Template menu.

  The first alternate method is very similar to the <Tab> key method
  described earlier:

    ù Place the cursor at the end of the keyword, either on the last
      character, or one position past the last character as it would be if
      you had just typed the word.

    ù Press <Ctrl Tab> to display the Template menu.

    ù Select "Expand Word Before Cursor".  The keyword that you typed is
      replaced with the text in the template defined for that keyword.  (If
      the keyword is not defined, or is not available for the current file
      extension, no action occurs.)

  With the second alternate method, you do not have to type the keyword
  that is to be expanded.  This method is useful if you cannot remember
  a particular keyword, or if you do not want to type the keyword, or if
  you want to select a particular template for a keyword for which there
  are duplicates.  To use this method:

    ù Position the cursor where you want the expanded text from the template
      to be inserted.

    ù Press <Ctrl Tab> to display the Template menu.

    ù Select "List Templates (Add/Delete/Expand)".  A PickList is displayed of
      all template keywords readily available for the current file extension;
      that is, the keywords for all local templates defined for the current
      extension, and all global templates.

    ù If the keyword that you want to expand is not included in this limited
      PickList, press <Ctrl Enter> to display a PickList of all template
      keywords that are defined.  This PickList includes even those keywords
      for templates that are local to other file extensions.

    ù Once you have located the desired keyword, move the cursor bar to that
      keyword and press <Enter>.  The template defined for the selected
      keyword is inserted into your text at the cursor position.


Deleting an Existing Template
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  To delete a keyword from the Template dictionary:

    ù Press <Ctrl Tab> to display the Template menu.

    ù Select "List Templates (Add/Delete/Expand)".  A PickList is displayed of
      all template keywords readily available for the current file extension.

    ù If the keyword that you want to delete is not included in this limited
      PickList, press <Ctrl Enter> to display a PickList of all template
      keywords that are defined.

    ù Once you have located the desired keyword, move the cursor bar to that
      keyword and press <Del>.

    ù The editor displays a prompt box to verify that you want to delete the
      selected keyword.  Place the cursor bar on "Yes" and press <Enter>.
      Both the keyword and its defined template are permanently removed from
      the Template dictionary.

  PickLists" in the chapter on "Command Prompts and PickLists.")
