Load as many files (long filenames supported) as Window's virtual memory will allow.  Files may be loaded in normal text mode or in binary mode (great for editing/viewing non-ASCII files), and additionally offers a HEX mode view, which can be toggled on/off for each file. Use the editor's video macro to adjust the size of the editor's display on the Windows desktop, choosing one of the predefined window sizes, a custom defined size, or choose to use the maximum columns/rows of Windows desktop. Some of the many features of the editor include: Powerful macro programming language (over 500+ commands, including the ability to call DLLs) with debugger; multi-language compiler support; load and/or execute macros from within the editor, or from the command line; configurable menus/keyboard; block marking operations (includes column, character, and line based blocks); regular expression search/replace; color syntax highlighting; spelling checker; pop-up ASCII chart; Windows clipboard support (in addition to editor's internal clipboard); interactive configuration; context-sensitive help system; GUI interface and more! Other key features - Wheel Mouse support; Font selection; Enhanced printing; Multilevel Undo/Redo; option to search subdirectories for matching files when loading or selecting files; search external files for a string; dynamic visual brace match; Browse mode for Read-Only viewing of files; Handy startup menu option; Multiple user-interface files, featuring common windows key assignments; New for this release - Single-instance option; Transparent mode option; Editor-on-top option; 30+ new macro language commands/variables and command enhancements.</Char_Desc_2000>
