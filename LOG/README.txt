  Macro           Log
  Author          Carlo Hogeveen
  Compatibility   TSE v4 upwards, Windows and Linux
  Version         v1   14 Mar 2022

  This macro helps another macro to log lines to a log file.

  Log lines are prefixed with the date and time.

  USAGE
    The macro is used by executing it as follows:
      log open <filename>
      log write <any text>
      log close

    If <filename> already exists, then logging is appended to it.

  INSTALLATION
    Copy this file to TSE's "mac" folder, and compile it there.

  TODO
    MUST
    SHOULD
    COULD   (Let me know if you want any of these.)
    - An extra parameter <handle>, so macros can write to multiple log files
      at the same time.
      Example usage:
        log open <filename>           Returns <handle> in MacroCmdLine.
        log [handle] write [text]     A handle must be before write and close
        log [handle] close            to make it distinguishable from <text>.
    - If <filename> is a folder, create a new uniquely named log file in that
      folder.
    - If no <filename> is supplied, create a new uniquely named file in a
      default folder.
