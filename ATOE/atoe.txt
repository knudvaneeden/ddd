1) Change into the TSEPro directory.
2) Unzip the atoe.zip into the TSEPro directory.
This should add the following files to the TSEPro directory:

atoe.txt -this file
atoe.dll -helper dll
atoe.mac -ASCII to EBCDIC macro
atoe.s   -source

3) Move atoe.mac and atoe.s to the MAC subdirectory.

4) Run the editor to install the macro, as follows:

g32 -eatoe

You will be prompted for the extension for EBCDIC files, and
the record length to use for such files.

Quit the editor when you have answered both questions.

The macro should now be installed.

5) Now, run the editor, and load an EBCDIC file.  If the
extension matches the one you specified, the file should
automatically be translated to ASCII.  When you save the
file, you will be prompted as to weather you want to save it
as EBCDIC (the default) or ASCII.
