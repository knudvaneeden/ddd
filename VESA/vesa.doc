VESA.S - a macro for The Semware Editor

Purpose:
   Allows to switch to any of the available text modes
   that your VESA compatible VGA graphics card supports.

Required:
   PC compatible computer
   VGA graphics card with VESA support
   The Semware Editor pre-release 1.0 or beta-test version up to 1.60a
   (will likely work with newer versions too)

What is VGA VESA?
   VGA VESA is a standard for programming VGA graphics cards.
   It's available in most VGA graphics cards that are in use today.
   For many old VGA cards small TSR programs are available to add
   VESA compatibility where it is not already included in the
   on-board bios.

Usage:
   You can either run the file VESA.MAC from within the macro menu
   or load the file VESA.MAC and use the new keyboard binding (see below)
   or edit the last lines of VESA.S to create your own keyboard binding,
   recompile and then load it.
   The included file VESA.MAC was compiled for the pre-release.
   If you are using a newer version, you will need to compile VESA.S.
   To do this just copy VESA.S and VESA.BIN to your TSE directory
   and issue the command SC VESA

Keyboard binding:
   The macro contains 6 new keyboard bindings that replace the
   default binding of <alt f9> to Dos(). You can easily modify
   them (see Usage above). The default keyboard binding is:
      <alt f9> <v>  VesaMenu()                      // VGA VESA only
      <alt f9> <1>  Set(CurrVideoMode, _25_lines_)  // all cards
      <alt f9> <2>  Set(CurrVideoMode, _28_lines_)  // VGA only
      <alt f9> <3>  Set(CurrVideoMode, _43_lines_)  // EGA and VGA
      <alt f9> <4>  Set(CurrVideoMode, _50_lines_)  // VGA only
      <alt f9> <D>  Dos()

Included files:
   VESA.DOC  you are reading this right now
   VESA.MAC  precompiled macro, load this from the macro menu
   VSEA.S    source for VESA.MAC, compiling needs VESA.BIN
   VESA.BIN  assembler subprograms
