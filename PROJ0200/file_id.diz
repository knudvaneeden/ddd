<05-19-02> PROJ v2.00
Requires TSE Pro/32 v2.8 or higher.

- Automatically configures itself the first
  time you run it.
- For programmers, it supports CTags and BSC
  symbol information.
- No more having to remember paths; PROJ
  builds a list of all the files in your
  project and autocompletes them for you.
- Remembers keyboard macros, clipboard, and
  more between editing sessions.
- Associate projects with directories, and
  automatically load the appropriate project
  when TSE is started from that directory.
- Now with a DLL that makes it much faster
  than before!
- See README.TXT inside for more info.
