umm.s - Version 1 Revision 30 - a macro
written with TSE-PRO GUI 4.0. This macro
works with a raw TSE-PRO or TSEJr User Macro
html page copied from the SemWAre site and
pasted as text into TSE. The macro converts
that raw unformatted text into a sortable
column format. The macro then has the ability
to convert this column format into a more
readable paragraph format, and back again.
Both the macro-created TSE-PRO and TSEJr
formats use the same column and paragraph
placement and appearance. An extensive
description help screen is available at the
start menu. The latest revision can be found
