<19-Jun-2002> - TSE Pro v2.5 and TSE Pro/32 v2.8/3.x/4.x
---  Replaces FilePal.zip dated 11-12-2001  ---
---  or earlier                             ---

FilePal will save, for a given file,
the current position and bookmarks, plus
editing parameters Insert, AutoIndent,
WordWrap, Margins, TabType, TabWidth,
ExpandTabs, EOLType and EOFType.

Default values for these parameters may
also be associated with extensions,
directories and drives.  Put a file on
AutoTrack and the current position,
parameters and bookmarks will be saved
automatically each time the file is quit
and restored on reloading. FilePal keeps
track of any number of files, even if
not loaded during the previous editing
session. FilePal also supports automatic
execution of specific macros linked to
filenames, extensions, directories and
drives.

This version fixes an issue with Long File Names.
