This is a free floating database.  No entry is too small or too large
(depending of course on the amount of memory available).  An entry can
be a single character, although that wouldn't make much sense. Or all the
way up to a full fledged novel.  Mostly it is used for tid bits of
information you want to keep, but don't want to clutter up your computer
with hundreds or even thousands of files.  Hence this data base.

It comes in two forms.  A menu driven macro called "DB"  It contains all
the macros.  However, for those who like to execute their own commands,
modules are enclosed.

Suggestion:  Unless you want to change the name of the files, such as:
database.skp and topics.txt, you can run as is, if you create a
directory in your TSE directory called database and then copy the
mentioned files there.

If you're wanting to save something to the database mark it first before
calling either "DB" (menu) or "dbs".  You will be prompted for a
trigger.  A trigger is something that you can associate the information
with.  You can enter as many triggers for one subject as you like.  When
you've finished entering "triggers" hit the escape key and the marked
text will be saved to the database along with all the triggers appended
to the topics.txt file for easy access to when your memory fails.

Let's look at a typical example:

Mark the following text:

snip===============================================================snip
time distorts the mind as mind distorts time.
snip===============================================================snip

By activating either "DB" (menu) or "DBS" you will be prompted with:
"Enter a trigger name"

Let's enter the word:

time <and hit the enter key>
and then
mind <and hit the enter key>

The macro will insert a tilde (~) character and a blank space before the
word.

Therefore the entry inside the database would look like this:

snip===============================================================snip
~ time ~ mind

time distorts the mind as mind distorts time.

snip===============================================================snip

To look up that phrase you would use "DB" or "DBR" (for retrieve) where
you will be prompted for something to search for.  Type in "time" and
the macro will go right to the line:

time distorts the mind as mind distorts time.

Then, if you're like me and six months have lapsed and I can't remember
what's available in the database, there is a topics.txt file.  choose
this from the DB menu or the TL macro and that file list will be loaded.
use the up and down arrows or the find command to find what you want.
Then choose "DB" or "DBL" (for locate).  You will be sent directly to
the item in question.

Once you've found the information you want inserted into your current
file mark it and hit the <spacebar>.  The information will be inserted as
the database disappears.

It's pretty self explanatory, but some information is required to get
the concept.

Enjoy!!
