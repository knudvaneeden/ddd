  The macro 'SelectHelpMenu()' contains the following files.

  Files included in the zip:

  begquote.s               ; Put quotes at beginning of ASCII file Alt-i
  endquote.s               ; Put quotes at the end of an ASCII file Alt-i
  selhlp07.s               ; Source file for SelectHelpMenu() Alt-F1

  selhlp07.rdm             ; Read Me file - This File

  checkhlp.s               ; Quick check of *.hlp file for proper format
                           ; It is a small version of 'selhlp07' to
                           ; quick check a file for proper quoting

  ["tse.hlp"]          // QuickHelp text  'KeyAssignments_SemWare
  ["function.hlp"]     // QuickHelp text   grouped by function
  ["keybind.hlp"]      // QuickHelp text  'KeyAssignments' Mine or Yours
  ["newmacro.hlp"]     // QuickHelp text   for new macros


  This is TSE QuickHelp() macro intended to add additional HELP screens.
  To select press <Alt F1> or change this default key to one of your
  choice.  To compile this macro will require additional help files with
  various help formats in the same directory as the *.s file.

  You can make your own help file by putting the following header on any
  ASCII text file, enclose all of the text except the header in
  quotes, and then placing 'END' at the end of the text file.

  Header:

  helpdef  Definition_Name title  "Something to place in top
           window border"

  Text:

  All of text must be placed within quotes.

  To aid in placing the quotes around your text two(2) very basic macros
  are included.  First load both 'begquote.s' and 'endquote' compile
  both of them.  Use 'begquote.mac' first and then 'endquote.mac'.

  After loading 'begquote', place the  cursor on the first line that
  requires quoting. Press <Alt i> and then continue pressing <Alt i>
  until all lines of ASCII, including any blank line, start with a
  quote.  Then load 'endquote.mac', put cursor on the first line that
  requires and ending quote, continue to press <Alt i> until all lines
  of ASCII have a closing quote.  You could take your *.key file,
  enclose it in quotes, rename it *.hlp and use it as the basis for your
  key bindings.  The helpdef that is named 'Key Assignments' will be the
  file used with the Beta Help when 'Key Assignments' is clicked from
  the Help Table of Contents.

  For a sample of the correct format any of the *.hlp files included
  with this zip file will provide the correct format.

  An attempt was made to have ALL of the included help files reflect
  TSE's default key bindings except for the file 'keybind.hlp'.  The
  'keybind.hlp' is the default keybindings except where noted by '-tak'
  which are my own personal key bindings.  I may have goofed and not
  changed all of my personal keys and for that I apologize.  Of
  course you can edit any or all of the *.hlp files to reflect your
  personal key bindings and correct any goofs that I left in the files.
  After changing any of the *.hlp files it will be necessary to
  recompile the macro(selhlp07.s).

  If you have problems or find obvious errors, please let me know so I
  can correct any errors in the next release
